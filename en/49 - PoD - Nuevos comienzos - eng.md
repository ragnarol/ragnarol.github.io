### Scene 1: Triage and Bad News
**PCs present:** Yankee Fu, Paloma (Lyra).
**NPCs present:** Karin (Concerned sister, potential recruit; electronics/communications expert), GD Corp Paramedics, Shuttle Pilot.
**Location:** Downport (Planet Marduk).
**Ships:** Downpour of Marduk (Shuttle), Ginger (Far Trader, Captain Lyra/Paloma).

**Summary:**
Following the shuttle accident/attack, survivors are transferred to the Downport hospital in Marduk. Yankee Fu and the ship's dog receive treatment for serious injuries (bites), while Paloma and Karin are treated for minor contusions. During the transfer, Karin checks her phone and discovers that her brother, Lamor Lukowiak, an employee of Highport, is among those kidnapped by Oghma raiders. Paloma attempts to find information online about the missing persons but confirms that the chances of recovering them without paying ransom or going after them are nil.

### Scene 2: The Corporate Offer
**PCs present:** Paloma (Lyra), Yankee Fu.
**NPCs present:** Rica Holloway (General Development Company - GD Corp Executive; Archetype: Pragmatic Corporate), Karin.
**Location:** Hospital Room, Downport (Planet Marduk).

**Summary:**
Rica Holloway visits the injured to apologize for the incident on behalf of GD Corp. She explains that the attackers stole robotics, electronics, and kidnapped key personnel, including their chief engineer. As they have no jump-capable ships available, she offers the PCs a contract: 20,000 credits to transport her assistant, Elena Markoib, to GD Corp's port in Oghma. Additionally, she offers an intelligence contract: 100,000 credits for orbital information about Oghma and up to 500,000 credits for information obtained on the surface. Paloma shows interest but does not commit immediately.

### Scene 3: Johnny Belem's Stash
**PCs present:** Jimmy, Phoenix Corbin.
**NPCs present:** Johnny Belem (Criminal contact/Smuggler; Archetype: Low-level but effective smuggler).
**Location:** Basement Bar and a Farm on the Continent (Planet Marduk).
**Ships:** Sarcomond (Unknown Model, Captain Jimmy/Daniel Blau).

**Summary:**
Jimmy and Phoenix meet with Johnny Belem, an old contact. Belem takes them to an isolated farm where he is hiding the merchandise destined for Drinax: two 5-ton crates containing imperial-stamped **Particle Barbettes**, "fallen off a truck" (stolen from a supply ship). Jimmy buys ammunition and a ballistic vest (*Flak Jacket*) for Phoenix. Belem warns that getting this military merchandise off the planet will be complicated and suggests using the post-attack chaos to their advantage.

### Scene 4: Dinner and Planning
**PCs present:** All (Yankee Fu, Paloma, Jimmy, Nemo, Phoenix Corbin).
**NPCs present:** Johnny Belem (briefly), Karin (at the end), Finan.
**Location:** Restaurant/Bar near the Spaceport (Planet Marduk).

**Summary:**
The group meets for dinner after being discharged from the hospital (Yankee and Paloma are still recovering but stable). Jimmy reports on the particle barbettes and the urgency of taking them to Drinax to fulfill King Oleb's request. The decision of whether to accept GD Corp's job is debated. Ultimately, they decide to decline the passenger transport to Oghma to avoid losing time but verbally accept the intelligence contract for the future.
They plan to land the *Ginger* near the farm (illegally) to load the barbettes. To cover the operation from the authorities and justify the cargo, Paloma arranges the purchase of 40 tons of local fish at a low cost as legitimate commercial merchandise.

### Scene 5: Recruitment and Departure
**PCs present:** Paloma, Jimmy, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Karin.
**Location:** Outside the Restaurant/Streets of Downport (Planet Marduk).
**Ships:** Ginger (Far Trader), Sarcomond.

**Summary:**
Paloma informs Rica Holloway that they cannot take her assistant due to a commercial urgency in another direction but remain interested in the espionage mission. Paloma convinces Karin to join the crew of the *Ginger*, promising her that the work in Drinax will provide the means to eventually search for her brother.
For the return journey, it is decided that the *Ginger* will carry the weapons and the fish, while the *Sarcomond* will travel in parallel. Nemo offers to travel in the *Sarcomond* with Jimmy to help him navigate the legal and blockade issues expected in the Torpol system, using his diplomatic and forgery skills.
