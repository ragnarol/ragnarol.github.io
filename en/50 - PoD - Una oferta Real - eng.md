### New Faces and Old Vices

**Location:** Spaceport (Marduk)
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Far Trader, Captain Lyra Vance), *Sarcomond* (Asimite Ship, Captain Jimmy)

**Scene Summary:**
Before departing Marduk, the group consolidates its forces. They recruit Karin, a communications expert who joins motivated to save her brother. Lyra tries to foster cohesion within The Ginger's crew through social activities (cooking and cinema), seeking to lift Nemo's spirits. On the *Sarcomond*, Jimmy and Corben manage their undisciplined group of pirates, while Nemo falsifies ship documentation and Ben Parr shares his surreal economic theories.

### Echoes from the Surface
**PCs present:** None (Narration of past events)
**NPCs present:** Pika (Survivor diplomat), Goran Dragic (Survivor soldier), Jefa Galks (Tribal leader, old and tough - The Matriarch), Walter Ondo (Ambitious botanist - The Martyr).
**Location:** Vespexer Settlements (Drinax / Surface)

**Scene Summary:**
The events that occurred weeks ago on the surface of Drinax are revealed. The diplomatic team (Pika, Goran, and Ondo) achieved an initial agreement with Jefa Galks, offering technology in exchange for loyalty. However, facing an imminent Aslan attack, Walter Ondo made the unilateral decision to use the *Banshee* to intercept the enemies, sacrificing himself in an explosion that saved the others but destroyed the ship and ended his life.

### Shadows in the Gas Giant
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Nemo, Jimmy, Corben
**NPCs present:** Crews of The Ginger and Sarcomond.
**Location:** Gas Giant (Torpol System)
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Far Trader, Captain Lyra Vance), *Sarcomond* (Asimite Ship, Captain Jimmy)

**Scene Summary:**
The flotilla arrives in the Torpol system. To avoid authorities' attention due to the *Sarcomond*'s illegal status, they avoid the main station and perform a refueling maneuver (scooping) in a peripheral gas giant. During the tense wait, Lyra instructs Nemo on Drinax court protocol, reviewing the personalities of Lady Hil and Princess Rao to avoid diplomatic incidents upon their arrival.

### Breaking the Blockade
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Nemo, Jimmy, Corben
**NPCs present:** Crews.
**Location:** Deep Space (Drinax System)
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Far Trader, Captain Lyra Vance), *Sarcomond* (Asimite Ship, Captain Jimmy), Aslan Scout Ship (Scout 100t, Enemy).

**Scene Summary:**
Upon jumping into the Drinax system, the ships are immediately detected by the Aslan blockade. An enemy scout ship ambushes them. Lyra coordinates the tactical sensors to guide shots, while Nemo and Corben operate the defensive turrets. Despite the enemy's evasive maneuvers, the combined firepower of the *Sarcomond* and The Ginger manages to disable and destroy the Aslan ship, allowing the group to advance towards the planet, which is revealed to be riddled with enemy signals.

### War Audience and Letter of Marque
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Jimmy, Nemo, Corben
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (King of Drinax, wounded, in partial armor - The Warrior King), Lord Drax (Head of the Guard - The Loyal Protector), Sergeant Britolar (Star Guard).
**Location:** Floating Palace / War Room (Drinax)

**Scene Summary:**
The characters land on a Floating Palace marked by the siege and are brought before King Oleb. The monarch has converted a game room into his tactical operations center. After confirming Ondo's death with regret (which elicits visible anger from Jimmy), Oleb shifts the tone to a solemn and martial one. He grants the characters the *Letter of Marque*, legalizing their criminal activities under the banner of Drinax. He entrusts them with the vital mission of strangling galactic trade to finance the survival and rebirth of the kingdom.
