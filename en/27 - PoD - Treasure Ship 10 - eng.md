### The Cemetery Trap
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fermín, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** Salvedes (Imperial Marine, aggressive, martial arts expert), Wolf (Corpse with a broken neck).
**Location:** Abandoned cemetery (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene Summary:**
The group sets an ambush for **Salvedes** in an abandoned industrial cemetery filled with niches and a hermitage. Upon positioning themselves, they discover the corpse of their companion **Wolf** with a broken neck; **Salvedes** was already there. The marine throws a smoke grenade and attacks **Fermín**. A brutal hand-to-hand combat ensues where **Salvedes** disarms and immobilizes **Fermín**, attempting to stab him. **Jimmy** fires his Gauss Rifle, grazing **Fermín**, and finally **Nemo**, using his grav-belt to gain height, fires his laser rifle and takes down **Salvedes**, leaving him mortally wounded before being finished off.

### Forensic Cleanup
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fermín, Álvaro, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** None alive.
**Location:** Abandoned cemetery and a ruined industrial ship (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships:** Terrestrial van.

**Scene Summary:**
After the combat, the group decides to leave no trace. They strip **Salvedes**' corpse of all equipment (Imperial laser rifle, *body pistol*, armor, knife). **Álvaro** and **Fermín** handle the "cleanup": they extract an eye and a finger from the marine for potential future biometric uses. Subsequently, they move the body to an isolated area where they dismember and burn it using quicklime and fuel to prevent genetic identification, disposing of the remains and unwanted equipment in different locations.

### Infiltration and Gossip
**PCs present:** Pika, Álvaro (Mentioned).
**NPCs present:** The Astrogator "Blue" (Modified human female from the planet Dolberg, Sindal sector. She has blue skin, layers of fat, and gills).
**Location:** Mess hall and barracks of the **Martin II** (Imperial Ship).
**Ships:** Martin II (Imperial Freighter, Captain Torso).

**Scene Summary:**
Inside the **Martin II**, **Pika** tries to extract information from the Astrogator. She discovers that she is from Dolberg (an aquatic world), that she worked in the merchant navy, and that she becomes nervous when talking about astrogation and the jump chamber. In parallel, **Paloma** hacks **Captain Torso**'s computer. His emails reveal that he is an incompetent from a good family (Pax Rulin) who despises his crew (especially officer **María Gad**) and complains to his mother that "they don't make marines like they used to."

### Change of Position
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fermín, Pika (via communication), Álvaro.
**NPCs present:** Tía, Krish.
**Location:** Camp on land and Orbit of Arunisiir.
**Ships:** Banshee (Light Destroyer, PCs), Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
The group decides that the **Banshee** is vulnerable on the ground. They order **Tía** and the NPC crew (taking **Wolf**'s body) to take the ship to orbit and maintain radio silence, activating stealth to make scanning difficult. **Pika** establishes an encrypted and brief communication protocol to maintain contact between the ground team and the ship. They prepare to wait for the remaining 6 days until the convoy arrives, while on the **Martin II** suspicions begin to arise due to **Salvedes**' absence.
