### Scene 1: The Reunion at the Port
**PCs Present:** James Ondo, Nemo, Honor Boon, Pika, Fermín, Kaimana.
**NPCs Present:** Saldan Zett (Mentioned, merchant captain).
**Location:** Spaceport (Drinax).
**Ships:** *The Banshee* (Harrier, Captain James Ondo), Saldan Zett's Ship (Free Trader).

**Summary:**
The merchant Saldan Zett lands on Drinax bringing a "package" for Nemo: Fermín, an old acquaintance and burly thug who has spent everything to join the crew in search of fortune. Captain James Ondo and the rest of the *Banshee*'s crew welcome Fermín at the port. They catch up, describe their roles, and Fermín makes his "man of action" and party-goer profile clear. James offers him an official position and shows him the ship, mentioning the frozen prisoners they intend to recruit. As they prepare, they receive a notification from the Hawk Guard for an immediate and discreet audience with the King.

### Scene 2: Royal Audience and Reproaches
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** King Oleb XVI (Fat, drinker, frustrated, Archetype: Decadent but Cunning King), Hawk Guards.
**Location:** Private chamber in the Floating Palace (Drinax).

**Summary:**
The crew is escorted through maintenance tunnels to a private chamber where King Oleb awaits. The King is disappointed with the *Harrier*'s performance: 12 jumps and only two minor prey (Free Traders). Oleb criticizes their focus on diplomacy (like with Clarke) instead of the aggressive piracy needed to obtain tangible resources for reconstruction. He demands they bring riches, industrial materials, or machinery, not just words. James tries to defend his diplomatic achievements, but the King insists they need to be a real threat to trade. Pika requests access to the Scholars' Tower to search for ancient maps, which the King grants.

### Scene 3: Errands in Drinax and Purchases
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Fermín, Pika, James Ondo.
**NPCs Present:** Rachando (Merchant, humble and normal appearance, Archetype: The Informer/Fixer), Kletus (Mentioned, android).
**Location:** Bazaar and Scholars' Tower (Drinax).

**Summary:**
During their day off before the ceremony, the characters run errands. Nemo takes Fermín to meet Rachando, a local merchant who procures "difficult" imports. Nemo establishes a business relationship, offering the *Harrier*'s services for future needs, both legal and illegal. Meanwhile, Pika researches in the Scholars' Tower, and James buys a rare NAS device (life detector). Other members purchase medical supplies and ammunition.

### Scene 4: The Star Ceremony
**PCs Present:** All (except Chris).
**NPCs Present:** Lady Hil (Influential noble, Archetype: The Political Manipulator), Lía Ondo (James's sister), Alvarito (Mentioned as famous on TV).
**Location:** Royal Court (Drinax).

**Summary:**
A formal ceremony is held where Lady Hil gives a patriotic speech about Sindal's values. Captain James Ondo is called to the stage to receive the *Star of Sindal* for rescuing a compatriot (Nemo). Lía Ondo, James's sister, is the one who bestows the medal; James winks at her, and she responds with a slight smile. Nemo attempts to gain prominence unsuccessfully. After the ceremony, James has a brief diplomatic "confrontation" with Lady Hil, implying that they both seek glory for Drinax and suggesting future alliances.

### Scene 5: Upgrades and Thaw
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** Abra Harper (Miner/Mechanic around 50 years old), Wulf Blue-Axe (Ex-convict, cannibal, sharp teeth).
**Location:** Ship *Banshee* (Space).

**Summary:**
Now on the ship and departing Drinax, the crew uses resources (Chip Shares) to redecorate and upgrade the cabins and hull of the ship, making it more luxurious and comfortable. Later, they proceed to thaw the two prisoners from the cryo-stasis pods: Abra Harper and Wulf Blue-Axe. Both survive the process without serious repercussions. Wulf is enthusiastically welcomed by Fermín and Nemo (who value having a "tough" cannibal on the team). Both agree to join the crew.

### Scene 6: Jump to Pourne
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** None direct (Spaceport control mentioned).
**Location:** Pourne System.

**Summary:**
The crew establishes training routines to improve their skills during voyages. They jump to the Pourne system. Upon arrival, they detect considerable traffic of heavy freighters and smaller ships. The planet has a high Technological Level (TL 10) and a strong network of defense satellites and an active fleet, presenting a more dangerous and bureaucratic scenario than usual.
