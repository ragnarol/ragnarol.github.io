# Clear Accounts and Broken Ships

**PCs present:** Honor Boone, Daijiro, Pika, (Nemo's and Nacho's PCs).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh, Princess Rao (Pragmatic and direct), Prince Harrick (Tired but proud), Lady Hil (Diplomatic), Chief Galx (Mentioned as a contact).

**Campaign Development:**
*   **Financial Reorganization:** The *Ginger*'s accounts have been settled following the sale of merchandise (Common Electronics) and advanced weapons. Debts with the deceased Goran Dragic have been paid off, and **Daijiro** has been integrated into the Letters of Marque and the crew as his practical replacement.
*   **Krrsh's Operations:** The Vargr privateer has been patrolling the trade route (Sindalia Main). He has had encounters with imperial freighters and Aslan, achieving considerable loot (almost 3 million credits), although his ship suffered severe damage in the process.
*   **Drinax Logistics:** After the battle, Drinax is full of foreigners (crews from Birni, Clarke, representatives from Blue). This complicates discretion and resupply, as there are not enough shipyards or spare parts for everyone.
*   **Route Planning:** A new short-term action plan has been drawn up: travel to **Hilfer** for repairs and purchases, jump to **Ergo** to investigate a stranded ship (possible component salvage), and finally go to **Kteiroa** to fulfill the deal with **Utea**.

**Loose Ends:**
*   **The Salvage at Ergo:** It is known that there is a "dead" ship on the planet Ergo (red zone), which could contain the power plant Utea needs. Environmental (radiation) and hostile dangers of the planet remain to be ascertained.
*   **Diplomacy with Birni:** It is still pending to see how the invitation of the regent of Birni to King Oleb evolves. Lady Hil suggests that any information about the ancient Sindal Empire (possibly an expert on Dostoevsky) would be helpful.
*   **Utea's Commission:** The industrial components (power plant, water recycling, pipes) to be delivered in Kteiroa in exchange for the spy network are still missing.

**Session Joke:**
During recruitment on the surface of Drinax (among the Vespexers), Nemo's PC, who considers himself a local hero ("people know me"), rolls an absolute critical failure (double 1) on his Social roll. The table erupts in laughter, joking that instead of being received as a hero, people want to lynch him or that his fame is terrible. The GM (Juan) resolves it narratively by saying that, due to the presence of foreigners, he must be extremely discreet so as not to reveal that he is a pirate, turning the failure into a moment of comedic tension.

### Settling Accounts and Krrsh's Loot
**PCs present:** Honor Boone, Daijiro, Pika, (Nemo's and Nacho's PCs).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Vargr, aggressive and reckless, *mentioned through mechanics*).
**Location:** Drinax (Drinax/Sindal).
**Ships:** Ginger (Harrier, Captain Honor Boone), Scout (Scout Model, Captain Krrsh).

**Summary:**
The session begins with **Honor Boone** and the group crunching numbers. The profits from sales in Cordan are clarified, and the estate of the deceased **Goran Dragic** is managed. Immediately after, Krrsh's activity and his ship *Scout* are resolved through an abstract mini-game. The players roll for him: Krrsh attacks imperial and Aslan freighters, sometimes unarmed and other times with nasty surprises. He achieves a "jackpot" (3 million credits) but his ship ends up in the red, with severe structural damage after engaging escorted ships. The tithe for **King Oleb XVI** is calculated.

### War Damages and Logistics
**PCs present:** Honor Boone, Daijiro, Pika.
**Location:** Floating Palace (Drinax/Sindal).
**Ships:** Maui (Mercenary Cruiser, Captain Nemo/Nacho), Ginger (Harrier, Captain Honor Boone).

**Summary:**
The condition of the *Maui* and the *Ginger* after the Battle of Drinax is assessed. The *Maui* has hull and critical damages, and the *Ginger* needs maintenance. Upon attempting repairs in Drinax, they discover that the system is saturated and lacks industrial resources. They decide to use their own spare parts to patch up essentials (spending tons of cargo on field repairs). The need to leave the system to find competent shipyards and supplies becomes evident.

### Audiences at the Floating Palace
**PCs present:** Honor Boone, Pika, Daijiro, (Nacho's PC).
**NPCs present:** Princess Rao (Pragmatic, *Noble administrator*), Prince Harrick (Melancholy but satisfied, *Tired warrior*), Lady Hil (Astute, *Diplomat*).
**Location:** Royal Court, Floating Palace (Drinax/Sindal).

**Summary:**
The group meets with royalty. **Honor Boone** informs **Princess Rao** about the mission in Cordan and Goran's death; Rao accepts **Daijiro** into the Letters of Marque under the captain's criteria. **Prince Harrick** offers his condolences for Goran and praises the performance of Blue's prototype fighters, suggesting promoting that industry. **Pika** speaks with **Lady Hil** about the delicate diplomatic situation with Birni and the possible visit of King Oleb; Hil emphasizes the importance of obtaining experts in Sindal history to impress the Birnians. It is made clear that Drinax does not want pirates to "defecate where they eat": they must sell their hauls on other worlds to gain influence, not on Drinax.

### Recruitment and Roadmap
**PCs present:** Honor Boone, Daijiro, (Nemo's PC, Nacho's PC).
**Location:** Vespexer Settlements (Drinax/Sindal).

**Summary:**
The group defines their plan: go to **Hilfer** (where there is technology) to repair the ships and buy the machinery for **Utea**, then stop by **Ergo** to salvage an abandoned ship that **Daijiro** has news of, and finally go to **Kteiroa**. They need extra crew (gunners and pilots). Nemo's and Nacho's PCs go down to the surface to recruit among the Vespexers and ex-convicts. Despite a dice fumble, they manage to get basic crew (cannon fodder and operators), although they don't find specialists like astrogators. They prepare to leave Drinax for Hilfer.
