# Session Title: Cordan Escape and the Drinax Dilemma

**PCs present:**
*   Lyra (The Captain)
*   Clayton (Medic, severely wounded)
*   Goran (Deceased this session)
*   Yankee Fu (Prisoner)
*   Nemo
*   Corven

**Important developments in the PCs' lives or the campaign:**
*   **Goran's Death:** He sacrifices himself on Cordan to allow his companions to escape.
*   **Yankee Fu's Capture:** It is confirmed he is alive but a prisoner in an enemy facility, undergoing interrogation and truth serum.
*   **Diplomatic Strategy:** The group decides to postpone a suicidal rescue to travel to Torpol. The goal is to acquire information or experts in Sindalite history to impress the Regent of Byrni and secure the alliance before launching the fleet attack.

**Loose ends:**
*   Yankee Fu's final fate and whether he will survive until the attack.
*   The repair and use of the combat robot Corven wants to fix.
*   The imminent arrival of Clark's fleet and the Regent, and whether King Oleb will live up to "imperial" expectations.

### Scene 1: Wheat Field Pursuit
**PCs present:** Lyra, Clayton, Goran.
**NPCs present:** Karim (Inexperienced crew member), Enemy soldiers (Well-armed paramilitaries with air support).
**Location:** Farmland and backroads (Cordan).
**Ships:** *Ginger* (PC ship, remotely piloted/by Karim), "Dragonfly" Gravicopter (Enemy vehicle).

**Summary:**
Following the chaos in the town, Lyra drives an armored car with a severely wounded and unconscious Clayton in the back, while Goran follows on a stolen motorcycle until it runs out of fuel. The group attempts to reach the ship *Ginger* cross-country to avoid police checkpoints, hiding the car in a barn. However, an enemy gravicopter with advanced scanners and a squad of soldiers locates them. Goran decides to stay behind to ambush the soldiers and buy time, managing to take down one, but is strafed by the enemy craft's automatic cannon, dying instantly. Lyra and Clayton run towards the *Ginger*, which lands clumsily piloted by Karim. Under heavy fire, they manage to board and escape the planet, leaving Goran's body behind.

### Scene 2: Prisoner of War
**PCs present:** Yankee Fu.
**NPCs present:** Drinaxian and Vespex prisoners (Captives), Facility guards (Aslan/Hostiles).
**Location:** Prisoner cell (Enemy facility, presumably on or around Cordan).
**Ships:** None.

**Summary:**
Yankee Fu is chained in a dark room with other prisoners. Although not brutally physically tortured, he is subjected to interrogations with truth serum, involuntarily revealing part of the group's plans. During his captivity, he forms a bond with a Drinaxian prisoner (who becomes a Contact). Security is high and escape seems impossible for the moment.

### Scene 3: Politics and Protocol on the Floating Palace
**PCs present:** Nemo, Corven.
**NPCs present:** Lady Hil (Pragmatic and concerned), King Oleb XVI (Delusional, eager for battle), Captain of the *Star of Torpol* (Gallant, anachronistic, "space Paladin" archetype), Bri (Hawk Guard).
**Location:** Floating Palace, Private Dining Room, Throne Room (Drinax).
**Ships:** *Star of Torpol* (Mentioned).

**Summary:**
Back on Drinax, the survivors reunite with Nemo and Corven. Lady Hil informs them of the complicated diplomatic situation: the crew of the *Star of Torpol* expects to see a legendary Sindalite Empire, but Drinax is in ruins and the King is eccentric. Nemo and Corven intensely debate whether to launch an immediate, ill-prepared assault to rescue Yankee or play the political game.
Nemo attempts to convince King Oleb and the knights of Torpol to lead a heroic assault on enemy facilities, but they refuse to act without the Regent's formal order or the arrival of the full fleet, seeing it as an unworthy or suicidal mission without proper support. Ultimately, the group decides the best option is to travel to Torpol to seek relics or experts to help stage the "imperial grandeur" needed to appease the Regent of Byrni, and to coordinate their return with the massive fleet attack.
