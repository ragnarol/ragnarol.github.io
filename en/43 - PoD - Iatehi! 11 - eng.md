# Session Title: Blood in the Jump and Crossed Destinies

**PCs present**
*   **Fermín** (Played by Nacho. Dies during the session).
*   **Goran** (Played by Juan).
*   **Pika** (Played by Paloma).
*   **Nemo** (Played by Nemo/Speaker_09).
*   **Fomega** (New character, pilot, played by Speaker_01).
*   **Nacho's New PC** (Ex-convict artist, in creation process).

**NPCs present**
*   **Kuk Norra** (Male Aslan, invader. Physically described as "Chuck Norris with ears", orange fur. Armed with a Gauss pistol and a *Crescent* sword. Archetype: Enemy/Invader).
*   **Female Aslan** (Invader. Armed with a heavy revolver and claws. Archetype: Enemy/Accomplice).
*   **Bespexers** (Minor crew members, one possibly blind. Archetype: Mooks/Expendable Crew).
*   **King Oleb XVI** (Mentioned as the original owner of the ship *Scarlet Loot*).

**Plot Development and Campaign Objectives**
*   **PC Death:** Fermín dies during an Aslan boarding after a failed jump.
*   **Crew Resources:** It is established that Pika owns 50% of the ship *Scarlet Loot* (a freighter that belonged to King Oleb) and Nemo has acquired a yacht and TAS membership thanks to his status.
*   **New Additions:** The backstories of the new characters who will replace losses or join the group are being shaped (a Navy pilot and an ex-convict artist).

**Loose Ends**
*   **Pika's Condition:** She is incapacitated and possibly crippled after the jump and combat; cryosleep ("the fridge") is discussed to save her.
*   **The Prisoner:** The female Aslan is unconscious and tied up; her fate has not been definitively resolved.
*   **Integration:** How the new characters (Fomega and Nacho's new one) physically meet the current group still needs to be narrated.

## Scene 1: Ambush in Jump Space

**PCs present**
*   Fermín
*   Goran
*   Pika (Incapacitated)
*   Bespexers (Ally NPCs)

**NPCs present**
*   **Kuk Norra** (Aslan invader. Archetype: Elite Warrior).
*   **Female Aslan** (Aslan invader. Archetype: Combat Companion).

**Location(s) and/or Planet(s)**
*   Command Bridge and Engine Room (PCs' Ship, Jump Space).

**Ship(s) mentioned**
*   PCs' Ship (Model unknown, Captain Pika/Fermín).

**Scene Summary**
The ship makes a dangerous jump within a planetary sphere, causing severe physical and mental effects on the crew (nausea, irritability, memory lapses). Pika is incapacitated by vomiting. Taking advantage of the chaos, two Aslans board the bridge. **Kuk Norra**, a humanoid-looking Aslan, and a female attack.

Fermín attempts to defend himself by firing from the pilot's chair, but his armor does not withstand Kuk Norra's Gauss pistol fire, and **Fermín dies** on the spot. The female Aslan takes Pika hostage. Goran arrives from the engine room, engages in hand-to-hand combat, and after a tough confrontation where he receives several shots, manages to kill Kuk Norra and leave the female unconscious. The scene ends with the surviving crew deciding to place Pika in a cryogenic chamber to try to save her and dealing with Fermín's death.

**Scene Summary**
The players spend the rest of the session creating new characters and advancing existing ones according to *Traveller*'s creation tables:

1.  **Fomega (New PC):** Creates a character who attempted to be a *Belter*, was forcibly recruited by the Army (Infantry), and later managed to enter the Navy as a pilot of small craft, participating in diplomatic missions and surviving a mutiny.
2.  **Nacho (New PC):** Creates an "artist" and *performer* who defines himself as a victim of the system. He served a term in prison (where he learned to fight and *Streetwise*) for a crime he claims he did not commit. He finishes his creation as an artist with political rivals.
3.  **Nemo:** Advances his career as an Agent and Noble/Diplomat. He returns to Drinax to work in administration. He obtains significant benefits: a Yacht, TAS (*Travellers' Aid Society*) membership, and Ship Shares.
4.  **Pika (Paloma):** Rolls for accumulated benefits. She obtains partial ownership of a *Free Trader* type ship. The GM establishes that this ship is the **Scarlet Loot**, a former pirate ship of King Oleb XVI, now a freighter in poor condition.
