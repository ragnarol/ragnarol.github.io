# Session Title: Night Siege in the Ruins of Marduk

**PCs present:**
*   Nemo / Den (whose real name is Felix Corven)
*   Lyra
*   Jimmy
*   Kleiton
*   Yankee Fun (Nacho)

**NPCs present:**
*   Karin (Ally of the group, archer)
*   Evan (Ally of the group)
*   Finan (Ally of the group)
*   Emilia (Leader of the locals, carries a pistol and torch)
*   Eclia (Emilia's daughter, 12-year-old girl with a shotgun)
*   Lorn (Local elder, leg injured, wise figure)

*   Altin (Local, adult male)
*   Hav (Local, teenager)
*   Isk (Local, teenager)
*   Garin Einbrates (Local predatory creatures, "wise things with teeth")

**Campaign Development:**
*   The immediate objective is survival in a hostile environment (Marduk) after the shuttle accident, fleeing from potential slavers and local predators, which is a necessary prerequisite for any attempt at reconstruction or return to Drinax.
*   First diplomatic contact is established with native inhabitants of Marduk, achieving a temporary alliance.
*   A rescue signal is detected, opening the possibility of escaping the planet and continuing with the main mission.

**Loose Ends:**
*   The group must leave the ruins and find an elevated area to respond to the rescue signal, exposing themselves to new attacks.
*   Altin and other locals are injured after combat.
*   It is unknown if the pack of creatures (Garin Einbrates) is still lurking nearby or if there are more members.
*   The threat of Oghma's slavers remains latent, although they did not appear in this session.

## Scene 1: Encounter in the Ruins
**PCs present:** Nemo, Lyra, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fun.
**NPCs present:** Emilia (distrustful native leader), Eclia (armed child), Lorn (injured elder), Borgs, Altin, Hav, Isk, Karin, Evan, Finan.
**Location(s):** Ruins of an ancient city (Marduk).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
After fleeing the crashed ship and taking refuge in rocky ruins at dusk, the PCs are approached by a group of local natives led by Emilia. A tense initial confrontation occurs with weapons drawn. Nemo attempts to de-escalate the situation by showing empty hands and offering medical aid, while Lyra uses her translator to establish communication.
Once the tension subsides, the translator begins to function. The locals explain that they are far from their village hunting and were attacked by creatures called "Garin Einbrates" (translated as "extremely wise things with teeth that kill"), which injured the elder Lorn. The PCs explain they come "from outside" (a ship) and are looking for the large village/spaceport, a concept the locals are almost completely unaware of. Nemo treats Lorn's wound. A heavy storm begins to fall, and visibility is drastically reduced, forcing both groups to share the shelter.

## Scene 2: The Night of Teeth
**PCs present:** Nemo, Lyra, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fun.
**NPCs present:** Emilia, Eclia, Lorn, Borgs, Altin (severely injured local warrior), Hav (injured teenager), Isk, Karin, Evan, Finan.
**Location(s):** Ruins of an ancient city (Marduk).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Jimmy detects movement in the outside darkness and raises the alarm. Shortly after, several "Garin Einbrates" (similar to large dogs or deer, yellowish fur, and very fast) launch a coordinated attack on the camp.
A chaotic combat breaks out in the gloom, barely illuminated by flashlights and the bonfire.
*   A dog attacks Hav, injuring his arm.
*   Another dog attacks Altin, leaving him severely injured and on the verge of unconsciousness.
*   The PCs and locals respond with gunfire and melee weapons. Lyra and Jimmy manage to shoot the beasts. Den (Nemo) and Borgs fight hand-to-hand.
*   One of the dogs is brought down after being wounded by shots and finished off by Isk and Den.
*   The other animals, after making quick attacks and injuring their targets (including Isk and Nemo), retreat into the darkness, demonstrating tactical intelligence in attack and flight.
After the combat, Den tends to the injured (Altin, Hav, Isk, and himself). Rotating guards are organized to watch the entrances, with the PCs and locals collaborating to protect the perimeter for the rest of the night.

## Scene 3: A Signal in the Storm
**PCs present:** Nemo, Lyra, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fun.
**NPCs present:** Emilia, Karin.
**Location(s):** Ruins of an ancient city (Marduk).
**Ship(s):** Rescue Ship (Unknown, automatic signal).

**Scene Summary:**
During one of the watches, while the rain continues, Lyra's (or Karin's) communicator picks up a weak and intermittent signal. Upon analyzing it with electronics and sensor skills, they confirm it is an automatic looping message from a rescue ship. The message states they have found the wreckage of their shuttle, that the assailants have been expelled from orbit, and requests any survivors to respond.
The problem arises when the PCs realize that, due to interference from the ruins and the low power of their handheld communicators, they cannot respond from their current position. They must go outside and find a high point to transmit, which involves risking being attacked again by the beasts lurking in the darkness. Lyra informs Emilia of the situation, raising the need to leave to ensure their evacuation.
