# Honor, Lies, and Bureaucracy

**PCs present:**
* Fermín (Nacho)
* Pika (Emilio)
* Fomega (Álvaro)
* Captain Nemo (Juan)

**NPCs present:**
* Aowai
* Yankee
* Teao Polloc
* Santo Berislav
* Vicorus (mentioned in flashback)
* Dhurin (mentioned in flashback)

**Important campaign developments:**
*   **Diplomatic Front (Kteiroa):** Pika has returned with data from the planet Fantasy to try and convince the Aslan clans to attack there instead of Drinax. Teao Polloc seems receptive and begins to pull strings, although warmongering factions continue to target Drinax.
*   **Logistical Front (Pourne):** The crew of the *Banshee* has managed to acquire 10 tons of legal advanced weaponry to support defense or negotiation, bypassing local bureaucracy through bribery.
*   **Fomega's Background:** It is revealed that Fomega fled the surface of Drinax after medical negligence that cost the life of a Vespexer clan chief's son.

**Loose ends:**
*   **The Aslan fleet:** Although Teao is maneuvering, it is not certain if the warrior leaders (Iki, Eharl) will change their target from Drinax to Fantasy.
*   **Paloma's whereabouts:** She has not arrived at Pourne with the illegal weapons (tactical nuclear). The group has left her a message to meet in Borite between weeks 13-15.
*   **Secondary mission on Kteiroa:** Investigating the disappearance of some Vespexers, possibly at the hands of spies or disintegrators, remains pending.
*   **The informant Fiuq:** An influential "clanless" individual on Kteiroa whom they have not yet managed to manipulate or thoroughly investigate.

## Scene 1: The Electrician's Duel
**PCs present:** Fermín
**NPCs present:**
*   Aowai (Aslan Warrior, archetype of a proud challenger, wears combat armor).
*   Yankee (Aslan ally of Fermín, acts as assistant/second).
**Location:** Ihatei Camp (Planet Kteiroa).
**Scene Summary:**
While Fermín was repairing a toaster, he is surrounded by a group of Aslan. Aowai, a local warrior, challenges him to a duel upon hearing rumors of his combat prowess. Aowai removes his technological armor to fight on equal terms. Fermín attempts to dissuade him unsuccessfully and chooses to fight with a sword. After a brutal exchange of blows where Fermín is wounded, he manages to land a critical hit on Aowai, leaving him incapacitated and bleeding. Fermín spares his opponent's life and requests medical attention for him, earning the silent respect of those present. Fermín spends the following week recovering from his injuries at the spaceport.

## Scene 2: Memories of a "Doctor"
**PCs present:** Fomega, Captain Nemo
**NPCs present:**
*   Vicorus (Vespexer Clan Chief, mentioned in flashback).
*   Dhurin (Son of Vicorus, mentioned in flashback).
**Location:** The *Banshee* (Deep space / In transit).
**Scene Summary:**
During the journey, details of Fomega's last four years are revealed. After being expelled from the Scout academy, he lived as a vagabond on the surface of Drinax, working as a doctor for the Vespexer clans. His career ended abruptly when Dhurin, Chief Vicorus's son, died of a viral infection under his care (due to Fomega's incompetence, though he blames the virus). Fomega fled to the Floating Palace before the clan could exact revenge. It is also mentioned that he learned to pilot submarines on the aquatic planet *Number One*.

## Scene 3: The Fantasy Proposal
**PCs present:** Pika, Fermín
**NPCs present:**
*   Teao Polloc (Aslan Merchant Leader, archetype of an influential negotiator).
*   Aslan Females (Socializing group at the camp).
**Location:** Ihatei Camp (Planet Kteiroa).
**Scene Summary:**
Pika returns to Kteiroa after 9 weeks. He meets with Teao Polloc and presents him with manipulated scientific reports about the planet Fantasy. The main argument is that Fantasy, despite having a heavy atmosphere, is colonizable and has historical ties to the "Glorious Empire" (heretical enemies of the Hierate), making it a more honorable and richer conquest target than the wasteland of Drinax. Teao accepts the information to try and influence the invasion leaders. Pika attempts to pry information from a group of Aslan females by drinking with them, but only learns that the mysterious Fiuq has a feud with Teao's clan and that the warrior leaders are determined to go to Drinax.

## Scene 4: Bureaucratic Hell and Black Market
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fomega
**NPCs present:**
*   Santo Berislav (Customs Officer, archetype of a corruptible and weary bureaucrat).
**Location:** Spaceport (Planet Pourne).
**Ship:** *Banshee* (Captain Nemo).
**Scene Summary:**
The *Banshee* arrives at Pourne, a high-tech world (TL 10) with a corrosive atmosphere and a militarized, gray society. After a full day of filling out forms, they descend to the spaceport. They encounter endless queues. Nemo uses his social skills and a bribe of 300 credits to the official Santo Berislav to skip the wait and obtain the permits. Once inside, Nemo locates a technology supplier and purchases 10 tons of advanced weaponry for 1,275,000 credits (after negotiating a discount). They decide not to wait for Paloma any longer and leave an encrypted message indicating they are heading to Borite, with a planned route through Pahal and The World.
