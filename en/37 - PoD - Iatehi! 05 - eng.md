### Aggressive Negotiations at the Pit
**PCs Present:** Goran, Fermín.
**NPCs Present:** Iller (Aslan outcast, "derailed," addicted, toothless, and balding; archetype of the loser/cannon fodder), Various Aslan thugs (Archetype of drunk gang members).
**Location(s):** Outlaw camp, outcast area (*Kteiroa*).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
While waiting in *Kteiroa*, **Goran** and **Fermín** decide to infiltrate the lower area of the Aslan camp to look for recruits or information. They make contact with **Iller**, a marginalized, drug-addicted Aslan, with whom they play cards to integrate. The situation becomes tense when about a dozen drunk and hostile Aslan surround them with the intention of lynching them. Far from being intimidated, **Fermín** consumes combat drugs and, together with **Goran** (who uses his tactical knowledge to position himself), unleashes a massacre. Using *monoblades* and firearms, they eliminate several Aslan and cause the rest to flee. **Iller**, impressed by the unleashed violence, changes his attitude and becomes much friendlier towards the humans, seeing them as strong warriors.

### Interstellar Diplomacy
**PCs Present:** Pika.
**NPCs Present:** Teau (Agent of the clans, Aslan diplomat; archetype of the pragmatic functionary).
**Location(s):** Teau's tent, Aslan Camp (*Kteiroa*).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
**Pika** seeks an audience with **Teau**, the representative of the clans, to try to manipulate the direction of the *ihatei* invasion. He argues that attacking westward would upset the delicate balance of power in the Trojan Reach, while expanding eastward (towards *Fantasy*) would maintain the status quo and be more beneficial. **Teau** agrees with this view, revealing that the Hierate prefers to avoid unnecessary major conflicts. They agree that **Pika** will act as an scout; **Teau** gets him passage on a merchant ship to go to *Fantasy* and gather data that will make the planet appealing to the *ihatei*.

### Fleet Logistics
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Fomega.
**NPCs Present:** Jimmy (Mentioned via message), Paloma (Mentioned).
**Location(s):** *Drinax* and space route towards *Pourne*.
**Ship(s):** *Banshee* (Harrier, Captain Nemo).

**Scene Summary:**
Back in *Drinax*, **Nemo** and **Fomega** plan the next logistical steps. They decide to ignore **Horrax**'s request from *Blue* regarding the fighters, as the deal was not favorable. They leave orders for **Jimmy** to repair the captured ships and engage in piracy or join them when he is ready. They plot a shopping and supply route that will pass through *Pourne*, *Pal*, *The World*, and *Borite*, with the intention of meeting **Paloma** in *Pourne* to pick up illegal merchandise and technological equipment.

### The Paradise of the Naive
**PCs Present:** Pika.
**NPCs Present:** Aslan Merchant Captain (Merchant, ship owner), Inhabitants of Fantasy (Genetically modified humans, beautiful, simple, and primitive; archetype of "the noble savage").
**Location(s):** Jungle (*Fantasy*).
**Ship(s):** Aslan Merchant Ship (Small freighter).

**Scene Summary:**
**Pika** arrives in the *Fantasy* system, a world of low technological level and lush vegetation. He uses a drone and scientific tools to analyze the terrain, seeking to confirm that it is capable of sustaining an Aslan population. During his exploration on the surface, he encounters a group of native humans of extraordinary beauty (possibly the result of ancient genetic engineering) but simple intellect. Upon seeing how they react with childlike curiosity to his tools, **Pika** concludes that they are easy prey. He decides not to warn them and confirms that the planet is the perfect target (rich territory and zero defense) to sell to the Aslan, effectively condemning the local population to conquest.

### Rumors of War
**PCs Present:** Goran, Fermín.
**NPCs Present:** Iller (Aslan outcast).
**Location(s):** Aslan Camp (*Kteiroa*).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Weeks pass in *Kteiroa*. **Goran** attempts to manipulate **Iller** by appealing to his wounded pride to enlist as cannon fodder on the first ship leaving for war. Meanwhile, the most relevant political news in the camp is confirmed: **Iki** ("The Wise") and **Toijol** ("The Brave") have joined forces. They have sent messengers to their clans to gather a fleet with the specific objective of conquering *Drinax*, although the mobilization will take months to complete.
