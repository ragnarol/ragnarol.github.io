# Session Title: Intrigues among the Ihatei

**PCs present**
*   Nemo (Engineer/Mechanic)
*   Ondo (Juan - Noble/Artist/Diplomat)
*   Honor (Paloma - Broker/Trader)
*   Goran (Fomega - Spy/Technician)
*   Rocío (Nacho - Investigator)

**NPCs present**
*   **Caesil** (Renegade Aslan, PCs' guide. Archetype: The native guide).
*   **Utea** (Female Aslan, spaceport administrator. Pragmatic and business-focused. Archetype: The neutral merchant).
*   **Heihei "The Wise"** (Elderly Aslan, leader of the Tiquisto clan. Archetype: The old strategist).
*   **Teao** (Aslan from the Kaukei-Aer clan, diplomatic emissary. Archetype: The peacemaker/politician).
*   **Iki** (Aslan from the Hityowau clan, young, aggressive, charismatic, wears ceremonial battle armor. Archetype: The ambitious warlord).
*   **Fiuk** (Aslan information broker, sophisticated, speaks fluent Anglic. Archetype: The untouchable informant).
*   **Old Helio** (Renegade Aslan, clanless veteran warrior. Archetype: The ronin).
*   **Pika** (Crew member/Ally with technical and social skills).

**Important Campaign Developments**
*   The PCs discover that **Iki**, a charismatic *Ihatei* leader, intends to attack and conquer the **Floating Palace of Drinax**, seeing it as a glorious and technological target.
*   The group devises a strategic plan to prevent the attack on Drinax: intervening in an existing Aslan civil war in the **Acoaft** system. They plan to send supplies and weapons to the losing side (Iki's clan) to prolong the conflict and keep the *Ihatei* occupied far from Drinax.
*   The groundwork is laid for a "False Flag" operation by creating recordings and propaganda to sow discord among the assembled clans.

**Loose Ends**
*   The execution of the smuggling plan: The group must split up. One team will use the *Banshee* to carry supplies to **Acoaft**, while another must acquire these supplies (weapons, provisions) from nearby markets.
*   **Utea's** request: The port administrator requested a power plant (Power 60), water recycling systems, and PVC pipes in exchange for future favors. This remains pending.
*   The effectiveness of the disinformation campaign created by Honor and Nemo is yet to be seen.

## Scene 1: Land of Ice and Warriors
**PCs present:** Nemo, Ondo, Honor, Goran, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Caesil (Aslan Guide), Heihei, Teao, Old Helio.
**Location:** Spaceport and Ihatei Camp (Kteiroa/Kteiroa System).
**Ships mentioned:** Caesil's Ship (Kteiroa/Katiyuyi class Courier).

**Scene Summary:**
The group arrives at **Kteiroa**, an icy world full of *Ihatei* (landless second sons of Aslan). **Caesil** briefs them on local politics: there is tension between **Heihei** (who wants to attack the wealthy world of **Paal**) and **Teao** (who is trying to maintain peace). They learn of the arrival of **Iki**, a furious leader because the war he was going to participate in in the **Acoaft** system has ended prematurely due to alleged betrayal, leaving him without an opportunity for glory. An Aslan "influencer" broadcasting his exploits is also mentioned.

## Scene 2: Business at the Spaceport
**PCs present:** Ondo, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Utea (Female Aslan, administrator, mistakes Ondo for a "useless" human or female due to his artistic interests. Archetype: The business matron).
**Location:** Spaceport Cantina/Offices (Kteiroa).

**Scene Summary:**
While the group settles in, **Nemo** and **Ondo** speak with **Utea**. Ondo tries to converse about art and poetry, which confuses Utea, who only values utility and business. Nemo redirects the conversation towards technical matters. Utea reveals that the camp is overflowing its resources and requests help acquiring a power plant, water systems, and pipes. She suggests that if the PCs help her, she could be a valuable ally in the future.

## Scene 3: The Rumor Mill
**PCs present:** Honor, Nemo, Pika (assisting).
**NPCs present:** None directly, internal work.
**Location:** PCs' Ship (Kteiroa).

**Scene Summary:**
The group decides that the best defense for **Drinax** is an information attack. **Honor**, with technical assistance from **Nemo** and **Pika**, spends four days creating fake propaganda material (videos and audio). The goal is to convince the Aslan that the defeat of **Iki's** clan in the recent war was the result of trickery and dishonor, inciting them to return to fighting instead of seeking new targets. The forgery roll is successful, creating very believable material.

## Scene 4: An Audience with the Broker
**PCs present:** Ondo.
**NPCs present:** Fiuk (Information broker, polite but dangerous. Archetype: The informed Godfather), Aslan Guards.
**Location:** Fiuk's Ship (Kteiroa).

**Scene Summary:**
**Ondo** spends days painting a picture of the night camp to gain an audience with **Fiuk**. Fiuk receives him, appreciates the art, but quickly dismantles Ondo's cover, interrogating him about **Drinax** and **Clarke**. Fiuk confirms that the "Aslan tide" will eventually attack the Trojan Expansion and that Drinax is a current target for being an *Aerial* (floating world) that many have overlooked. Fiuk dismisses Ondo politely, making it clear he doesn't like spies, but pays his "debt" for the painting by letting him leave alive and with information: **Clarke** is safe for now, but Drinax is not.

## Scene 5: Listening to the Warlords
**PCs present:** Goran.
**NPCs present:** Iki, Heihei, Teao, Fiuk.
**Location:** Ihatei Camp, near an outdoor stove (Kteiroa).

**Scene Summary:**
**Goran** poses as a technician repairing a stove outside to eavesdrop on a high-level meeting. He overhears **Iki** presenting his plan to **Heihei**: conquer the Floating Palace of **Drinax**, information that **Fiuk** sold him. **Teao** tries to dissuade them, suggesting "softer" targets like **Fantasy** or **Sink**, arguing that attacking near **Borito** or **Paal** is dangerous due to their militarization. However, Iki seems obsessed with the glory of taking Drinax.

## Scene 6: The Old Soldier and the New Plan
**PCs present:** Nemo, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Iki's old servant (Elderly Aslan, honorable, sad about the defeat. Archetype: The resigned veteran).
**Location:** Hityowau Clan Camp (Kteiroa).
**Ships mentioned:** The Banshee (Heavy Fighter/PCs' Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
**Nemo** and **Rocío** manage to contact a member of Iki's retinue, an old warrior. Through careful conversation, they confirm that the clan would accept external help if presented as an opportunity to restore lost honor. The elder indicates that they would need about 25-27 tons of supplies and weapons to break the blockade and reactivate resistance in **Acoaft**. The group decides to activate "Plan Z": use the **Banshee** to carry out this smuggling, which will require splitting the group to buy the materials and transport them, with the ultimate goal of saving **Drinax** by diverting the invading fleet.
