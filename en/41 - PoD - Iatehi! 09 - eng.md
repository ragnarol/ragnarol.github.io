# Sacrifice in Acoaft

**PCs present**
*   **Ground Group (Kteiroa):** Pika (Emilio), Juan's Character (Marine), Nacho's Character.
*   **Space Group (Banshee):** Captain Nemo, Alvarito/Abra (Engineer), Paloma (Pilot), Tía (Gunner).

**NPCs present**
*   **Fiuk** (Aslan Leader, ground infiltration target).
*   **Iki** (Aslan, mentioned as "good people" and possible contact).
*   **The Aslan Judge** (Space assassination target, traveling in an escorted courier).
*   **Aslan Female** (Seen buying cheap supplies/rations).

**Campaign Development and Drinax Goals**
*   **Critical failure in space mission:** The attempt to assassinate the Aslan Judge to prevent him from declaring the end of the war and prolonging the conflict (favoring Drinax's plans) has resulted in the total destruction of the *Banshee* and the death of most of the group.
*   **Succession of command:** With Captain Nemo's death, it is suggested that Pika will have to assume the role of Captain due to his noble social status, essential for Drinax's political objectives.

**Loose ends**
*   **The fate of the Ground Group:** The survivors (Pika, Juan, and Nacho) are trapped on the surface with no ship to escape.
*   **The war:** Having failed the assassination, the Judge is likely to declare Aslan victory, consolidating his position and complicating the reconstruction of the Kingdom of Drinax.
*   **The "Trojan Horse" plan:** The infiltration plan on Fiuk's ship is designed but not yet executed.

## Scene 1: The Trojan Horse Plan
**PCs present:** Pika (Emilio), Juan's Character, Nacho's Character.
**NPCs present:** Fiuk (Aslan, antagonist/target), Aslan Female (Mentioned, distant behavior).
**Location:** Camp/Spaceport in Kteiroa (Surface).
**Ships:** Fiuk's Cargo Ship (Model unknown, Captain Fiuk).

**Scene Summary:**
The ground group heatedly discusses how to infiltrate Fiuk's ship to obtain information about the *Vespers* and their plans with Drinax. They discard hacking and direct assault due to a lack of stealth skills and tools. They devise a "Trojan Horse" style plan: acquire a large enough piece of art or statue to hide one of the PCs (possibly Nacho) inside. Pika, using his diplomacy, will present himself to Fiuk to deliver the "gift" and gain access, lying as little as possible or presenting himself as a noble of Drinax willing to negotiate land. As they debate, they observe the Aslan buying cheap food for humans, suggesting slavery.

## Scene 2: The Banshee's Last Stand
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Paloma, Alvarito/Abra, Tía.
**NPCs present:** Aslan Escorts and fighter pilots (Hierato Forces).
**Location:** Acoaft Orbit (Space).
**Ships:**
*   *Banshee* (High Guard/Stealth Ship, Captain Nemo).
*   Judge's Ship (200-ton Messenger/Courier, Captain Aslan Judge).
*   Fighter Squadron (Light Fighters, Aslan).

**Scene Summary:**
The crew of the *Banshee* locates the Aslan Judge's ship amidst a tangle of orbital traffic. Their plan is a lightning strike: destroy the Judge's ship before it jumps to hyperspace and flee. They initiate a stealth attack, firing missiles and the particle barbette, managing to damage the target ship's hull and cargo.

However, they are detected by the escorts. Five Aslan light fighters intercept the *Banshee*. A brutal combat (*dogfight*) erupts. Despite Paloma's piloting efforts, Alvarito/Abra's emergency repairs, and Tía and Nemo's defensive fire that manages to take down a couple of fighters, the *Banshee* is overwhelmed. They suffer critical damage to the power plant and maneuver drive. When they attempt to calculate an emergency jump to escape, the computer fails, and the accumulated damage is catastrophic. The *Banshee* is destroyed by concentrated fire from the fighters, resulting in the deaths of all PCs on board.
