**NPCs present**
Kira (Star Guard Anti-Spin), Tolis de Byrni (Regent of Byrni), Larisa Clark (Mercenary Contact/Ex-mercenary), Byrni Officers.

**Major Developments in PCs' or Campaign Lives**
*   The *Maui* group secures a military alliance with Byrni, convincing the Regent that King Oleb is the true heir to the Sindal Empire.
*   Regent Tolis insists on traveling personally to Drinax to meet Oleb, causing panic among the PCs due to the King's erratic behavior.

*   The *Ginger* group accepts a transport mission for Baroness Lux of Cordan as a test for a larger job.

**Loose Ends**

*   The actual contents of the 10 tons of cargo being transported to Cordan are unknown.
*   The nature of the "real" mission on Cordan remains a mystery until the cargo is delivered.

### Memories of Blue and Mid-Route Repairs
**PCs present:** Goran, Lyra, Clayton, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** None directly mentioned in scene.
**Location:** Deep space / Blue Markets (Blue Planet/System) / Arunisiir (Arunisiir Planet/System).
**Ships:** Ginger (Banshee/Sindal Model, Captain Goran Draghi).

**Scene Summary**
A brief flashback occurs to their time on Blue, where Lyra bought gifts for the crew (cigars, handicrafts, an easel for Goran, and *Coporoto* coffee) and combat training software. Subsequently, the ship jumps to the Arunisiir system. There, they land at the spacelane for repairs. They purchase spare parts, and working as a team, Fomega and Lyra manage to repair a loose wire in the maneuvering thruster, fixing the ship's critical problem. They also hear news about *Banshee* attacks on imperial ships, which worries them due to the description of their own ship.

### Welcome to the Anti-Spin Guard
**PCs present:** Felix Korven, Yankee Fu, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Kira (Star Guard Officer, disciplined soldier archetype, space "Roman"), Byrni Officers.
**Location:** Byrni Orbital Station (Byrni System).
**Ships:** Maui (Unknown Model, Pilot Yankee Fu), Kezer's Aurora (Patrol ship, Sindalite design).

**Scene Summary**
The *Maui* arrives in the Byrni system and is intercepted by the *Kezer's Aurora*. They are boarded by soldiers in old but functional *Battle Dress*. Kira, of the Anti-Spin Star Guard, reviews their diplomatic credentials. They are escorted to an orbital station that resembles a living museum of the old Sindal Empire: iron discipline, anachronistic aesthetics, and a rejection of cybernetic implants ("purity of the body"). During a dinner with officers, the PCs discover that Byrni considers itself loyal to the Sindal Emperor (even though he doesn't exist) and views pirates and *Aslan* as distant threats. Yankee Fu (Nacho) improvises a uniform with medals and "official pilot" patches to impress.

### The Audience with the Regent
**PCs present:** Felix Korven, Yankee Fu, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Tolis de Byrni (Regent and Lord Commander, elderly, serious, "Believer/Crusader" archetype).
**Location:** War Room / Bridge of the Station (Byrni System).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene Summary**
The PCs are received by Regent Tolis. Felix Korven (Nemo) deploys his diplomatic skills, appealing to historical brotherhood and the *Aslan* threat. Yankee Fu tells (embellished) stories of heroic combat against savages. Felix completely convinces Tolis that King Oleb XVI is the legitimate heir to Sindal. Tolis, excited like a religious fanatic, promises military aid but announces he will travel personally to Drinax to swear loyalty to the "Emperor." The PCs, terrified of how Oleb might behave, decide to rush back to Drinax to prepare. Tolis assigns them an escort.

### Technical Stop and Forward Escape
**PCs present:** Felix Korven, Yankee Fu, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Escort Captain (Radio voice).
**Location:** Purne Gas Giant (Purne System).
**Ships:** Maui, Torpol's Wake (Patrol Corvette/Escort).

**Scene Summary**
The *Maui* group begins their return journey. They make a stop on Purne. To avoid spacelane bureaucracy and save time, Felix convinces the escort (*Torpol's Wake*) to refuel at the gas giant, citing haste and "training" for the pilot. The escort reluctantly agrees and monitors the maneuver. After refueling, they jump towards Drinax, arriving a week before the other group at their destination.

### Business in Port Tanith
**PCs present:** Goran, Lyra, Clayton, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Local inhabitants and stevedores.
**Location:** Highport "Borderland Prime" / Port bars (Tanith System).
**Ships:** Ginger.

**Scene Summary**
The *Ginger* arrives at Tanith, an aquatic world with a varied technological level. While the ship is in the *Highport*, Lyra and Fomega go down to the bars to gather information about their next destination, Cordan. They discover that Cordan is a feudal agricultural world with three barons (Lux, Fero, and Halley) and that Baroness Lux is importing technology for the populace, which is unusual. Taking advantage of the local market, Lyra manages to sell the cargo of common electronics for an exorbitant price (1.2 million credits), clearing the group's finances.

### The Mercenary's Contract
**PCs present:** Goran, Lyra.
**NPCs present:** Larisa Clark (Contact, 50-60 year old woman, unkempt but dangerous appearance, "Hardened Veteran" archetype).
**Location:** Bar in Pilcoe City (Tanith System).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene Summary**
Goran and Lyra go down to Pilcoe City, a city full of mercenaries, to meet their contact, Larisa Clark. She evaluates them and offers them a job for a client (Baroness Lux of Cordan). They are looking for a small group with resources and initiative to operate behind enemy lines. As an initial test, they must transport 10 tons of boxes "no questions asked" to Cordan. If they succeed, the real mission will be revealed. The group accepts and prepares to jump to Cordan.
