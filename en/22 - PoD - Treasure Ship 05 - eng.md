# Session Title: Infiltration, Chemistry, and the Shadow of Pirates

**PCs present:** Paloma, Fomega (James Hondo), Emilio, Nemo (Ondo/Admiral Darokin in disguise), Fermín, Nacho (Jimmy).
**NPCs present:** Chris (Aslan, allied crew member), Ebubekir (Merchant/Supplier), Polo (Engineering Supervisor), Tia (Ally/Crew member), Captain of the *Hopeful Wanderer*.

**Important developments in the PJs' lives or the campaign:**
*   The hacking equipment has been successfully introduced and assembled on the target ship, allowing Paloma to access security cameras.
*   A contingency plan has been established, seeking shelter in ruins and negotiating distraction vehicles, in anticipation of the imminent arrival of a pirate fleet.
*   Fomega has begun manufacturing a chemical compound (possibly poisonous or hallucinogenic) using local flora to incapacitate the crew.

**Loose ends:**
*   **The mysterious building:** Fermín and Jimmy spotted a building with antennas near the *Banshee*'s landing zone, which could be a threat or a point of interest.
*   **The pirate scout ship:** It has been confirmed that a *Scout*-class ship conducted a reconnaissance of the planet and jumped away, indicating that the pirate attack is imminent (the time window is narrowing).
*   **Opening the vault:** They still lack the physical key or the necessary DNA to open the vault, although they have access to the electronic systems.

### Scene: Return to Base and Sighting
**PCs present:** Fermín, Nacho (Jimmy).
**NPCs present:** Chris (Aslan, wearing a respirator, wags his tail happily upon seeing them).
**Location:** Forests and outskirts of the city (Arunisiir).
**Ships:** Banshee (Mentioned as landing site).

**Scene summary:**
Fermín and Jimmy return from their supply run through the forests of Arunisiir in the pressurized truck. They bring two tons of jewelry/gems for the Aslan tribute, medicine, food, and drinks. During the return trip, near where the *Banshee* is landed, they spot a small building with antennas on the horizon about 10 kilometers away. They decide not to investigate for the moment to avoid drawing attention and continue to the safe house, where Chris, the Aslan, greets them enthusiastically. Fermín spends the afternoon getting drunk and socializing with the crew to alleviate boredom.

### Scene: Bribing Ebubekir
**PCs present:** Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Ebubekir (Merchant/Supervisor, wears a worn business suit, respirator hanging, thick glasses, bald and thin; archetype of a corruptible official).
**Location:** Industrial Zone, Supervisor's Office (Arunisiir).

**Scene summary:**
Nemo disguises himself using a kit and assumes the identity of "Joe Bigman." He heads to the industrial zone to meet Ebubekir, the supplier of spare parts for the target ship. Nemo offers him a deal: to include a package (the disassembled hacking computer) in the legitimate cargo going to the ship. After some negotiation, they agree on the price. Nemo pays 20,000 credits upfront as a guarantee and promises to deliver jewels later. The goal is for the parts to enter without raising suspicion in the maintenance cargo.

### Scene: Reception and Equipment Assembly
**PCs present:** Paloma, Emilio, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Tia (Ally covering for Paloma), Polo (Supervisor, demanding and suspicious).
**Location:** Cargo Deck and Engineering Room (Target Ship).

**Scene summary:**
Inside the ship, Fomega and Emilio work hard to avoid raising suspicion from their supervisor, Polo. Fomega tries to win Polo over unsuccessfully and acts erratically. Taking advantage of Tia covering her at work, Paloma sneaks to the cargo area when Ebubekir's shipment arrives. She manages to retrieve the computer parts hidden among the spare parts. Later, she finds a safe corner without cameras and manages to assemble the laptop, leaving it ready for operation. Emilio tries to investigate a previously tampered panel but reaches no clear conclusions beyond that someone checked it and closed it improperly.

### Scene: The Improvised Centrifuge
**PCs present:** Fomega.
**NPCs present:** None directly.
**Location:** Safe House (Arunisiir).

**Scene summary:**
At night, in the safe house, Fomega begins to fabricate improvised equipment using a blender, wires, and other utensils. Her goal is to create a centrifuge to process local flora and chemicals (drugs/cleaning agents) in order to synthesize a gas (poisonous or hallucinogenic) that can be introduced into the ship's ventilation system. It is determined that this process will take her several days of nocturnal work and will cost her health (Endurance points) due to lack of sleep and the use of stimulants.

### Scene: Escape Preparations and News from Space
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fermín (Nacho).
**NPCs present:** Captain of the *Hopeful Wanderer* (Merchant, ally/acquaintance of Nemo).
**Location:** Spaceport Ruins and Market (Arunisiir).
**Ships:** Hopeful Wanderer (Merchant Vessel), Pirate Scout Ship (Sighted in orbit).

**Scene summary:**
Nemo and Fermín look for a secondary safe place in case things go wrong. They find a ruined building near the spaceport that can serve to hide a truck, although it needs repairs. Nemo visits the Captain of the *Hopeful Wanderer* and negotiates the purchase of a fleet of identical cars to use as decoys/distractions on the day of the operation. During his errands at the port, Nemo learns of a worrying rumor: a *Scout*-class ship (scout type, jump 2) has entered orbit, scanned the area, and jumped away quickly before being intercepted, confirming that the pirates are exploring the system and their arrival is imminent.

### Scene: Hacking and Frustration
**PCs present:** Paloma, Fomega, Emilio, Nemo, Fermín.
**Location:** Interior of the Ship and Safe House (Arunisiir).

**Scene summary:**
Back on the ship, Paloma uses the assembled computer to hack the system. She gains access to the security cameras (difficulty 12 overcome) and views the corridor leading to the vault, but not its interior. She tries to review old recordings to see who tampered with the panel, but there is too much data to download. She prepares the system to loop the cameras when necessary. The group discusses with frustration the lack of a definitive plan, debating whether to act before the pirates arrive or use the pirate attack as cover. It is confirmed that a marine (Yan) has changed her shift and will have days off soon, which could be an opportunity or a risk.
