## The Hunt for Aslan

**PCs present**
All PCs in their combat stations (Bridge and Turret).

**NPCs present**
*   Captain Aslan (Commander of enemy freighters, aggressive and territorial).

**Location(s) and/or Planet(s)**
*   Deep space near Paal (Paal System).

**Ships mentioned**
*   *La Banshee* (PCs' ship).
*   Three Aslan Light Freighters (Targets, armed with 2 turrets each).
*   System Defense Ship (400 tons, patrol class).

**Scene summary**
The crew of *La Banshee*, after an intense debate on approach tactics and sensor usage, decides to ambush three ships they identify as Aslan light freighters carrying livestock and merchandise. They attempt a stealthy approach and issue an ultimatum for surrender. However, they underestimate their prey: the Aslan freighters are heavily armed and unyielding. A space battle erupts. Rocío and "El Perro" manage to damage one of the enemy ships with the particle cannon and missiles, but *La Banshee* sustains hull damage (7 points) from return laser fire. The situation worsens when they detect a 400-ton System Defense Ship rapidly approaching. Outnumbered and outgunned, the PCs decide to abort the attack, execute evasive maneuvers, and prepare for an emergency jump to flee.

## Welcome to the Technocracy

**PCs present**
All PCs.

**NPCs present**
*   Sofía (Android guide, chrome appearance and metallic voice, archetype of a helpful but unsettling AI).

**Location(s) and/or Planet(s)**
*   Spaceport (Planet Tech-World / Teche-World System).

**Ships mentioned**
*   *La Banshee*.

**Scene summary**
After a week of jumping, *La Banshee* arrives in the Tech-World system. The planet exhibits a very high technological level (TL 14+). Landing is managed by nanomachines that construct the runway in real-time on a black surface. Upon disembarking, they are met by swarms of micro-robots that take DNA samples and by Sofía, a robotic guide. Sofía offers them advanced services (cybernetics, cloning, weapons) and explains that the planet is a refuge for scientists fleeing technological religious restrictions. The atmosphere is aseptic, unsettling, and extremely expensive for the PCs' current economy.

They discover that the treasure fleet passed through, but the main ship, the *Martin II*, suffered a jump drive malfunction and had to be left behind on the planet **Arunisiir**. They obtain specific details: the malfunction is in the engineering section, it is defended by a squad of elite Imperial Marines, its first officer Jagad is looking for war veterans, and its navigator, Osha, is native to an aquatic world in the Trojan Expansion.

## Repairs and New Route

Before departing, the crew dedicates a few hours to repairing the hull damage sustained during the ambush in Paal, spending some of their spare parts and money.
