## Planning and Separation
**PCs present:** Paloma, Nemo, Fomega, Pika.
**NPCs present:** None explicitly mentioned in the dialogue, reference to those who remain (Fermín, Goran).
**Location(s):** Kteiroa (System/Planet), Asim (System/Planet).
**Ship(s):** Kyu-class Courier (Mail, 3-ton capacity), Banshee (Mentioned parked on Drinax).

**Scene summary:**
The group decides to split up to optimize time and acquire supplies for the imminent Aslan war. They agree that Paloma will take a fast ship (Courier) to Theev to acquire illegal merchandise, while Nemo and Fomega will head to Drinax to retrieve the Banshee and purchase legal supplies along the trade route. Pika will remain in Kteiroa infiltrated in the Aslan camp to sabotage or gather information. The entire group travels first to Asim, where they separate; Paloma continues on her route, and the others seek passage to Drinax.

## The Theev Black Market
**PCs present:** Paloma.
**NPCs present:** Black Sun Widow (Security guard), Kasyl (Crew member, helps with contacts), Ex-military Woman (Weapons dealer, pragmatic).
**Location(s):** Black Sun City (Theev/Sindal System), La Calavera Spaceport (Theev).
**Ship(s):** Courier (Paloma's ship).

**Scene summary:**
Paloma arrives on Theev, a pirate planet where the crew has restricted access (banned), but manages to land discreetly. She attempts to use her skills to find illegal weapons and contact Miria Silverhand, but initially fails, only buying legal advanced weapons. Kasyl intervenes and makes contact with an ex-military woman in a bar. Paloma sells the advanced weapons to regain liquidity and buys 3 tons of illegal weapons for 630,000 credits. After closing the deal, she leaves the planet quickly to avoid trouble.

## Audience with The Wise
**PCs present:** Pika.
**NPCs present:** Hrai "The Wise" (Aslan Leader, elderly but strong, wears armor and computer), Aslan Guards.
**Location(s):** Yatei Camp (Kteiroa/System).

**Scene summary:**
Pika, posing as an engineer and expert in robotics/cybernetics interested in culture, secures an audience with Hrai after presenting him with a valuable gift (a statuette worth 200,000 credits). Hrai reveals his master plan: he seeks not indiscriminate plunder, but to conquer Drinax for its strategic position and technology (like the Tower of the Scholars) to establish a generational base. Pika attempts to persuade him to attack Tech-World or Fantasy instead, arguing for better resources and trade routes, but Hrai dismisses the idea, remaining firm in his plan for Drinax.

## The Trade and Diplomatic Route
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Rao's Butler (Royal servant), Lord Wrax (Admiral, concerned military), Fighter Salesman (Commercial on Blue).
**Location(s):** Drinax (Planet/Floating Palace), Torpol (Trade planet), Blue (Industrial planet), Clarke (Planet).
**Ship(s):** Banshee (Retrieved on Drinax).

**Scene summary:**
Nemo and Fomega arrive on Drinax. Nemo warns Admiral Wrax about the Aslan threat and requests an audience with Princess Rao, though he only manages to leave the message through her butler. Later, they travel to Torpol where they purchase 10 tons of food, 5 tons of medical supplies, and spices. They then jump to Blue, where Nemo presents himself as a dignitary to negotiate the purchase of space fighter squadrons; he obtains an offer of 9 million per unit and buys 2 tons of advanced vehicles. Finally, they pass through Clarke and return to Drinax to await Paloma, having spent weeks in the process.
