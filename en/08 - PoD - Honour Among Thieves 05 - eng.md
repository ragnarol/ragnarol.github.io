### Scene: Jump to the Unknown
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** Krrsh (Guide, crippled).
**Location:** Deep Space (between Marduk and Theev).
**Ships:** Banshee (Harrier, Captain Nemo).

After paying docking fees in **Marduk** (2,400 credits) and leaving Margaret ashore, the crew prepares to pursue the pirates who attacked Torpol and Clarke. Krrsh explains they are looking for **Ferrik** and his second, **Miria Silverhand**. Apparently, **Admiral Darokin** wants Ferrik dead. The crew plans to capture them to collect bounties from the victim planets and earn Darokin's favor. They perform a jump to an empty hex where Krrsh indicates a secret fuel depot. They refuel with hydrogen, refine it, and jump towards the **Theev** system.

### Scene: The Law of Lords and the Law of the Street
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** Krrsh, Port Woman (Enigmatic, "too perfect," possible clone/android).
**Location:** Black Sun (Theev).
**Ships:** Banshee.

They arrive in the **Theev** system, a desert world with a thin atmosphere. They land at the spaceport of **Black Sun City**, hidden beneath the surface. A mysterious woman greets them and explains the rules: in areas with red flags (Pirate Lords' territory) and the Upper District, violence is not permitted. In the rest (the canyons, the lower city), the "Law of the Street" rules. They are warned not to break atmospheric containment. Krrsh gives them a visual tour of the city, pointing out key locations like the Grand Hotel, the shipyards, and areas belonging to different factions.

### Scene: Purchases and Expensive Silences
**PCs Present:** All.
**NPCs Present:** Shop Vendor (One-eyed and toothless), Monk of the House of No Questions.
**Location:** Lower City, Second-hand Shop, House of No Questions (Black Sun/Theev).

The group descends into the dangerous Lower City. They purchase used chainmail armor (*Cloth*) for discreet protection. They decide to investigate Miria's whereabouts by going to the "House of No Questions," a place that mixes a church with a guild of assassins/healers. A monk attends to them and, after a long wait surrounded by the wounded and dying, asks for 100,000 credits for information about Miria. The group rejects the exorbitant price and decides to seek other avenues. Paloma attempts to bribe and investigate in local bars without success, only discovering who the local big shots are: **Petir Vallis** and the Aslan **Roll Iron Tooth**.

### Scene: Audience with the Psychopath
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Pika, Jim, Honor, Rocío.
**NPCs Present:** Petir Vallis (Pirate Lord, violent, hates Aslans), Miria Silverhand (Mentioned).
**Location:** Red Flag Tower (Black Sun/Theev).
**Ships:** Lion's Den (Corsair 600t, Captain Petir Vallis).

Nemo decides to take the initiative and the group heads to the tower controlled by **Petir Vallis**, marked with the corpses of disemboweled Aslans at the entrance. After a failed initial approach by Nemo to a guard, the group enters armed but in a "diplomatic" attitude. The tension is high due to Petir's hatred of aliens and outsiders. Nemo manages to secure an audience with Petir. The pirate captain demands payment. Nemo offers the Banshee's spice cargo (9 tons). Petir accepts the payment and reveals that **Miria Silverhand** is hiding in a dilapidated ship in the junkyard area.

### Scene: High-Society Diplomacy
**PCs Present:** Emilio.
**NPCs Present:** Naval Officer (Distinguished gentleman, "old school," Archetype: Renegade Imperial Officer or Gentleman Pirate).
**Location:** The Grand Hotel, Pink Pavilion Restaurant (Black Sun/Theev).

While the others head to the trenches, Emilio goes up to the Upper District with Krrsh seeking a more civilized environment. In the hotel bar, he is discreetly approached by two uniformed escorts who take him to an older man, dressed in impeccable naval uniform. This gentleman knows they are looking for Miria and Ferrik. He offers Miria's location "for free," in exchange for a promise: that Emilio and his ship will not appear there again for at least a year. Emilio accepts the gentleman's agreement. The officer hands him a note with the junkyard's address, confirming the same information the other group obtained, but at a different diplomatic cost.
