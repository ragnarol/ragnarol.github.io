### Scene 1: Escape from the Ghost Station
**PJs present:** Onor, Pika, Emilio (on sensors).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Vargr, abandoned pirate captain, starving and wounded - Archetype: The Betrayed Castaway).
**Location(s):** Sindalite Station "Allseed Dalyan" (Deep Space/Near Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** The Banshee (Harrier, Captain Nemo).

**Scene summary:**
Onor and Pika explore a ruined ancient Sindalite station searching for a sign of life. Onor is attacked by an insectoid creature (*Hunter Chamax*) and manages to drive it away after a precise shot, although the area's atmosphere is compromised. Emilio and Honor locate the target's life sign in a depressurized area. Honor performs a piloting and mechanical maneuver to cut the station's hull from the outside and extract the survivor: a dying Vargr named Krrsh. They bring him aboard the *Banshee* and place him in an improvised medical bay under surveillance.

### Scene 2: Captain Krrsh's Story
**PJs present:** All (Nemo, Jimmy, Emilio, Paloma, Honor, Pika, Fomega).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Vargr recovering, talkative and grateful), Margaret Blaine (Advisor/Spy - Archetype: The Pragmatic Mentor).
**Location(s):** The Banshee (In transit to the Marduk system), Borite (Planet/System Borite).
**Ships mentioned:** The Banshee (Harrier).

**Scene summary:**
Once recovered and fed (and after drinking whiskey), Krrsh reveals his identity. He was captain of the ship *Misery's Company* until his crew mutinied, led by Ferric Resten, and abandoned him to die. He explains that Ferric is fleeing Admiral Darokin and seeks protection in *Black Sun City*. Krrsh offers the access codes to this legendary pirate city in the Theev system and the location of a secret fuel depot. The crew debates recruiting him; Krrsh is helpful and eager for revenge. After a technical stop in Borite where Nemo mentions political contacts, they set course for the Marduk system, following Margaret Blaine's advice to ambush ships.

### Scene 3: Ambush in the Gas Giant
**PJs present:** Emilio, Paloma, Nemo, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** Margaret Blaine.
**Location(s):** Moons of the Gas Giant (Marduk System).
**Ships mentioned:** The Banshee (Harrier), The Cinsedani (Far Trader, Captain Bogan Erwin).

**Scene summary:**
The crew hides the *Banshee* on one of Marduk's gas giant moons. After two days of waiting with passive sensors, Emilio detects a *Far Trader* freighter approaching to refuel in the giant's atmosphere. Paloma executes a silent approach maneuver using the moons' gravity. When the freighter emerges from refueling, the *Banshee* appears at close range. Emilio successfully jams its communications, and Nemo, introducing himself as Captain Jameson Doe, demands its surrender under threat of opening fire with the turrets.

### Scene 4: The Gentlemanly Boarding

**Location(s):** Interior of the Cinsedani ship (Marduk System).
**Ships mentioned:** The Cinsedani (Far Trader).

**Scene summary:**
The target ship surrenders and powers down its engines. Fomega leads the boarding party in vacuum suits. Captain Erwin and his crew (four frightened individuals) cooperate fully. While Krrsh guards the prisoners, Margaret loots valuables from the cabins. Paloma and Fomega inspect the cargo: they find spices and, hidden, 20 tons of high-value illegal drugs. Nemo and Jimmy review the account books and discover that the *Cinsedani*'s crew is ruined and on the verge of losing the ship. A moral debate ensues about how much to steal from them. Finally, they decide to take the drugs (valued at 2 million, though difficult to sell) and part of the spices, leaving the ship operational and "pardoning" their lives and the rest of the cargo in exchange for future favors or information if they cross paths again.

### Scene 5: The Fate of the Loot
**PJs present:** Nemo, Jimmy, Emilio, Paloma, Honor.
**NPCs present:** -
**Location(s):** The Banshee (Marduk System).
**Ships mentioned:** The Banshee (Harrier).

**Scene summary:**
After releasing the *Cinsedani*, the crew discusses where to sell the stolen merchandise. Margaret suggests a fence in the Exocet system, but it's several jumps away. Considering that the *Banshee* needs urgent hull repairs and maintenance, and they don't want to lose track of the main pirates, they decide to stay in Marduk. They plan to sell the drugs there, expecting to get only 10% of their value due to a lack of reputation, but will use that money (approx. 200,000 credits) to repair the ship immediately and continue the hunt.
