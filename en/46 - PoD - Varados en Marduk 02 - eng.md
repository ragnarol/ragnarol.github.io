# Survival on the Forbidden Continent

**PCs present**
*   **Lyra (Dove):** Attempts to mediate diplomatically and gather information.
*   **Nemo:** Tracker and survival expert, distrustful of strangers.
*   **Fenix (Fomega):** Ex-military pilot with an eye implant (cybernetic eye), pragmatic and armed.
*   **Yankee (Nacho):** Suffers the beast's attack, fakes being more injured than he is at the end.
*   **Den:** Conducts reconnaissance and remains hidden at the end.

**NPCs present**
*   **Karin:** Communications officer of the spaceport. Native of Marduk (from the Downport). (Archetype: The Local Guide / The Informant).
*   **Jimmy:** Member of the crashed crew, "the fat one." (Archetype: The Cooperative Crew Member).
*   **John Clayton:** Captain of the crashed ship. (Archetype: The Defeated Captain).
*   **Finan:** Vargr dressed in a suit and tie. (Archetype: The Bureaucrat Out of His Element).
*   **Evan:** Passenger worried about his investments, carries an old tablet. (Archetype: The Greedy Civilian).
*   **Group of Natives:** Men and women with primitive firearms and leather clothing. (Archetype: The Xenophobic Survivors).

**Campaign Development and Long-Term Objectives**
*   There has been no significant progress in the reconstruction of the Kingdom of Drinax in this session, as the focus has been purely on immediate survival after crashing on the planet Marduk.
*   The context of Marduk is established: a planet with islands inhabited by isolationist people and a wild continent formerly bombed by the Sindal Empire.

**Loose Ends**
*   Who exactly are the natives who appeared in the ruins and what are their intentions?
*   What was the creature that attacked Yankee and is still lurking in the undergrowth?
*   Is there really a tracker or a mole among the survivors attracting hunters?
*   The condition of the wounded man being brought by the natives and whether the PCs can help him.

### Scene 1: Mistrust Under the Rain
**PCs present:** All (Lyra, Nemo, Fenix, Yankee, Den).
**NPCs present:** Karin, Jimmy, John Clayton, Finan, Evan.
**Location:** Bramble thicket (Planet Marduk).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Summary:**
The group advances under incessant rain through difficult terrain full of brambles, heading towards some rock formations. During the march, Lyra talks with Karin to get information about the planet. Karin explains that the population of Marduk lives on artificial islands (Downport) or isolated and xenophobic archipelagos, and that the continent where they are is a wild and uninhabited area, a former bombed zone of the Sindal Empire.
Meanwhile, Nemo and Fenix suspect that the pirates found them too quickly after the accident. They fear someone is carrying a tracker. Taking advantage of a moment to change into dry clothes, the PCs force the NPCs to submit to a search and to turn off all their electronic devices (tablets and phones) to avoid being tracked. Although there is initial tension, they manage to convince them diplomatically.

### Scene 2: The Prey and the Hunter
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** The group of survivors (Karin, Finan, etc.).
**Location:** Bramble thicket (Planet Marduk).
**Ships mentioned:** Hunter ship (Model unknown, hostile).

**Summary:**
While the group changes clothes and organizes equipment, they hear noises in the vegetation. A creature invisible among the brambles attacks Finan first (unsuccessfully) and, shortly after, lunges at Yankee, biting him in the leg and causing him an injury before disappearing back into the undergrowth.
Simultaneously, they spot the ship that shot them down patrolling the sky, searching for survivors. The group throws themselves to the ground, covering themselves in mud and hiding under the brambles to avoid the ship's sensors and sight. After a few minutes of tension, the ship moves away. Nemo and Fenix treat Yankee's wound and decide to move quickly towards the rocks before nightfall.

### Scene 3: The Ruins of the Ancients
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None active at the start (they are with the group).
**Location:** Ancient ruins (Planet Marduk).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Summary:**
Upon reaching the rock formations, they discover they are not natural, but ruins of an ancient city or structure millennia old (possibly from the Sindal era), with remains of asphalt and collapsed walls covered in vegetation. They find a room with a partial roof that offers shelter and discover remains of a campfire that has been out for at least a day, indicating recent human presence. They decide to camp there, trying to keep the light to a minimum and cover the openings to avoid being seen.

### Scene 4: Encounter in the Darkness
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Group of Natives (Female leader with an oil lamp, men carrying a wounded person, armed adolescents).
**Location:** Campfire room in the Ruins (Planet Marduk).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Summary:**
As they prepare to spend the night, Jimmy warns that lights are approaching. A group of five natives with a pre-industrial appearance (leather clothing, moccasins) and armed with gunpowder rifles and artisanal revolvers enters the ruins seeking shelter; they are carrying a wounded man.
The PCs decide not to ambush them. Den hides in an adjoining room to have a tactical advantage, while the rest (Lyra, Nemo, Fenix, Yankee) sit around the unlit campfire, trying to appear harmless. The natives enter, are surprised to see the strangers, and point their weapons at them while shouting in an unknown language that the PCs' translator cannot immediately decipher. Furthermore, they discover that there are a couple of native adolescents hidden on the flanks, also aiming at them. The session ends at this Mexican standoff point.
