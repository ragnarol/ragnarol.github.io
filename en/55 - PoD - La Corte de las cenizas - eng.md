# Session: The Siege of Drinax and the Ash Alliance

**PCs present:**
*   **Pika** (Emilio)
*   **Phoenix Corven** (Nemo)
*   **Yankee** (Nacho)

**NPCs present:**
*   **King Oleb XVI** (King of Drinax, depressed at the start, then motivated. Smokes cigars and is surrounded by screens.)
*   **Captain Brie / Bri Tolar** (Star Guard/Hawk, competent and loyal officer.)
*   **Rachado** (Bazaar merchant, dark skin, mustache, sells illegal or restricted technology.)
*   **Thao Polloc** (Imperial Consul, wears a pink ruffled robe, painted face, runes on forehead, pessimistic and dramatic.)
*   **Captain Gawain Dunkel** (Captain of the *Torpol's Wake*, solemn and pompous.)
*   **Lady Hil** (Courtesan, childhood rival of Phoenix, wears mourning with a black veil and holographic tear tattoos. Archetype: The Dramatic Lady/Organizer.)
*   **Ondo's Nephew** (Vespexer, attentive to the plants in Worm's Belly.)

**Campaign Development and Long-Term Objectives:**
*   **The situation in Drinax:** The planet is under blockade by an Aslan fleet (Ihatei). Planetary defenses have fallen, and the Floating Palace has lost control of them, forcing the King to hide.
*   **The coalition:** It is confirmed that a Byrni fleet is on its way, led by the Regent. The PCs are coordinating this fleet along with forces from Clarke, Blue, and the remnants of Torpol for a synchronized counterattack.
*   **The immediate plan:** Regain control of planetary defenses through an infiltration mission to protect the Palace and support the arrival of the allied fleet.

**Loose Ends:**
*   The success of the surface infiltration mission to hack/recover the ancient defenses.
*   The precise coordination of the fleets (Byrni, Clarke, Blue) to arrive simultaneously; if the timing fails, they could be destroyed separately.
*   The "party" or reception that Lady Hil is organizing to impress the Byrni allies.

### Scene 1: Back to Hell
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None (interaction with enemy ships).
**Location:** Drinax system space and high orbit.
**Ships:** *Maui* (PCs' Yacht), *Torpol's Wake* (Destroyed), *Ikilansioso* (Aslan Ekaosikuya-class escort), Ihatei ships (Fighters and modified freighters).

**Summary:**
The PCs return to the Drinax system to find it under siege. Their escort ship, the *Torpol's Wake*, is intercepted and destroyed by Aslan fighters, though its lifeboat manages to escape. The *Maui* is pursued by two enemy ships but manages to land at the Floating Palace. It is revealed that the *Imperatrix* (the stolen flagship) participated in the battle but had to hide after suffering damage, and that the planetary defenses were taken by the Aslans.

### Scene 2: Audience with the Ash King
**PCs present:** Phoenix Corven.
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (Apparently apathetic, "King of Ashes," surrounded by smoke and screens).
**Location:** Royal Chambers (Floating Palace, Drinax).

**Summary:**
Phoenix meets with King Oleb, who is demoralized and hiding, feeling like a powerless king. Phoenix uses their diplomatic skills and appeals to the King's ego and Sindalite honor, informing him of the arrival of the Byrni fleet and the Regent himself. They manage to rouse Oleb from his stupor, convincing him that he must act as an Emperor to receive his allies and prepare for the counteroffensive. Oleb reports that his daughter, Princess Rao, is in Clarke coordinating aid and that Prince Harrik is with Lord Drax on the *Imperatrix*.

### Scene 3: Logistics and Black Market
**PCs present:** Pika, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** Contacts at the Tower, Rachado (Bazaar Merchant, "fixer").
**Location:** The Tower (University) and The Bazaar (Floating Palace).

**Summary:**
While Phoenix is with the King, Pika goes to the Tower to get advice on military communications and intrusion software for the defense assault. Yankee goes to the Bazaar and finds Rachado, a foreign merchant. Yankee acquires espionage equipment, drones, a radiation-resistant computer, and material cutting tools, all under the guise of "work for the King." Rachado promises to procure scent inhibitors to fool the Aslans.

### Scene 4: The Prophet of the Apocalypse
**PCs present:** Pika, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** Thao Polloc (Imperial Consul, extravagant and fatalistic).
**Location:** An alley near the Bazaar (Floating Palace).

**Summary:**
Upon leaving their errands, Pika and Yankee are approached by Thao Polloc. The consul is terrified, convinced that the Aslans will destroy everything and that they are doomed. Pika tries to calm him and suggests he use his channels to call for help, but Polloc insists the blockade is total. Pika assures him that a plan is underway, leaving him with his despair and his imperial perfumes.

### Scene 5: Worm's Belly Incursion
**PCs present:** Phoenix, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** Vespexer Leaders, Ondo's Nephew.
**Location:** Worm's Belly (Drinax surface), a settlement made from ship debris and anti-radiation materials.
**Vehicles:** Flyer/Grav-car (PCs' vehicle).

**Summary:**
Phoenix and Yankee descend to the surface in a grav-car. On the way, they dodge a rocket fired by an unknown vehicle. Upon arriving at the Vespexer settlement "Worm's Belly," Phoenix gives a passionate speech to the mutants and survivors, appealing to their right to the surface and the need to expel the Aslan invaders. They manage to convince them to provide a support team, ground vehicles, and generate war noise to distract the enemy.

### Scene 6: Protocol and Strategy
**PCs present:** Pika.
**NPCs present:** Captain Brie, Captain Gawain Dunkel, Lady Hil (Phoenix's rival, event organizer).
**Location:** Hangar and Court Halls (Floating Palace).

**Summary:**
Pika receives the survivors of the *Torpol's Wake*. Captain Dunkel, very formally, requests an audience with the King, but Pika keeps him waiting with diplomatic excuses. Then, Pika seeks out Lady Hil, Phoenix's rival, who is in theatrical mourning. Pika manipulates her into organizing a grand reception for the Byrni fleet, appealing to the need to impress the allies. Concurrently, Pika coordinates the sending of couriers to neighboring systems (Purne, Hilfer) to instruct the allied fleets (Byrni and Clarke) to wait and coordinate for a joint, massive jump.

### Scene 7: Final Meeting
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None explicitly mentioned in the final meeting.
**Location:** Floating Palace.

**Summary:**
The surface team returns to the Palace. They meet with Pika and share their progress: they have the infiltration equipment, the support of the Vespexers, and the fleet strategy underway. They prepare for the critical mission: to descend to the surface again to infiltrate and recover the ancient planetary defense network before the allied fleet arrives. Yankee equips himself with the material acquired for the mission.
