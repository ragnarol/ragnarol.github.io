**NPCs Present:** Pika (Incapacitated), Kia (Incapacitated), "Cugnorra" (Male Aslan, Chuck Norris appearance, aggressive), Female Aslan (Raider, subordinate).
**Location:** The Ship (Jump Space / Dark Dimension).
**Ships:** The PJs' current ship (No specific name mentioned).

**Scene Summary:**
The ship initiates an interstellar jump. During the transition to jump space, the crew suffers severe physical and mental effects due to the "dark dimension." Pika and Kia are incapacitated by vomiting and migraines. Goran suffers mental effects (irascibility, memory gaps), and Fermín suffers severe physical effects. Taking advantage of the chaos, an Aslan with a Chuck Norris appearance ("Cugnorra") and a female Aslan board the bridge. The female takes Pika hostage, threatening her with a claw and demanding surrender.

### Scene: The Duel and Fermín's Death
**PJs Present:** Goran, Fermín.
**NPCs Present:** "Cugnorra", Female Aslan, Pika.
**Location:** Command Bridge (The Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
Combat erupts. Fermín, severely affected by the jump, fires his heavy revolver at the male Aslan, but the enemy's armor absorbs the impact. "Cugnorra" responds with a Gauss pistol on automatic fire, piercing Fermín's cover and armor, causing instant mortal wounds. Goran engages in melee combat with his sword against the Aslan leader, managing to wound him. In the chaos, the female Aslan fires, attempting to hit Goran, but accidentally hits her own companion. Goran seizes the opportunity to knock out the female Aslan. Goran attempts to aid Fermín with first aid, but his wounds are too severe, and he passes away. Goran secures the prisoners and attempts to place them in cryogenics/refrigeration.

**Scene Summary:**
Following Fermín's death, the creation and trajectories of the new characters and the evolution of the existing ones to form the new crew are narrated:
*   **Fomega's PC:** Joins the Navy, specializes as a pilot of small craft and flight, participating in diplomatic missions and preventing mutinies.
*   **Nacho's PC:** An artist/performer who ends up unjustly imprisoned. In prison, he hardens, learns to fight, and develops *fixer* skills. Upon release, he resumes his artistic career and criticizes political leaders, gaining enemies and fame.
*   **Nemo:** Consolidates himself as a noble and diplomat, working in the administration of Drinax. He acquires a Yacht, membership in the TAS, and social status.
*   **Paloma's PC:** Develops a successful career as a *Broker* (merchant). Through benefit events, she obtains partial ownership of the *Scarlet Plunder*, King Oleb XVI's former pirate ship, assuming the mortgage with the monarch.

The group consolidates as a mix of reformed criminals, military pilots, and noble diplomats ready to begin their campaign.
