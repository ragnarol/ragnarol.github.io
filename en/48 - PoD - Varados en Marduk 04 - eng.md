# Escape from Marduk's Ruins

**PCs present:**
*   Lyra Vance (Captain)
*   Jimmy (Captain Mendoza)
*   Kleiton
*   Yankee Fu
*   Den (Nemo / Second Corbin / Seneschal)

**NPCs present:**
*   Karim (Guide/Survivor)
*   Emilia (Leader of local natives)
*   Finan (Shuttle survivor)
*   Evan (Survivor dog/pet)
*   Lorn, Borgs, Dorem, and one of Emilia's daughters (Wounded/present natives)
*   Wise Beasts / "Dogs" / Camberwains (Hostile local fauna)
*   Marduk Port Authority personnel

**Important developments in the PJs' lives or the campaign:**
*   The group manages to contact rescue and survive Marduk's hostile environment, eventually reaching the Downport.
*   The existence of native human populations on Marduk's continents is confirmed, something the port authorities were unaware of or believed impossible.
*   The next immediate step is established: contact Jonny Belen in the port's underbelly.

**Loose ends:**
*   The fate of Emilia and her tribe, who decided to stay in the ruins despite the danger of the beasts and the offer of help.
*   The confirmed identity of the original ship's attackers (slavers or Oghma Barbarians are suspected, and Finan plans to join a class action lawsuit).
*   Den (Nemo)'s attempt to recruit or gain the loyalty of the survivors (Karim, Finan) through a pending dinner.

### The Decision in the Darkness
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fu, Den (Nemo).
**NPCs present:** Emilia (Protective tribal leader), Karim (Pragmatic ally), Finan, Evan.
**Location(s):** Ruins in the jungle (Planet Marduk).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene summary:**
The group discusses the best strategy for calling for rescue. They are sheltering in some ruins in the night rain, surrounded by predatory beasts. They try to convince Emilia and the natives to leave with them towards an area with signal coverage, but the natives, wounded and distrustful, prefer to fortify themselves in the shelter. Karim supports the PCs' plan to leave. Finally, they decide to leave the natives behind with some chemical lights and leave as a group (Lyra, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fu, Den, Karim, Finan, and Evan) towards a nearby elevated mound to try to contact the rescue shuttle.

### The Ascent and the Ambush
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fu, Den (Nemo).
**NPCs present:** Wise Beasts/Camberwains (Stealthy and lethal predators).
**Location(s):** Elevated mound in the Ruins (Planet Marduk).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene summary:**
Under a light rain and in the dim light, the group reaches a ruined building or mound about 6-7 meters high. Jimmy and Kleiton begin to climb to get a signal with their communicators, while the rest stand guard below. Kleiton detects movement, but is ambushed by a beast that jumps on him while he is climbing. Chaos erupts: Kleiton fires and falls into the void (managing to roll to avoid damage), while below multiple beasts attack the group.

### Combat in the Mud
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fu, Den (Nemo).
**NPCs present:** Karim (Armed combatant), Evan (Attacked dog), Wise Beasts/Camberwains.
**Location(s):** Base of the mound (Planet Marduk).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene summary:**
Frenetic hand-to-hand and close-quarters combat ensues.
*   **Lyra** is seriously wounded by a bite to the shoulder but manages to take down a beast with precise shots.
*   **Yankee Fu** tries to immobilize a beast by jumping on it, but is thrown against a wall, sustaining injuries.
*   **Den (Nemo)** fights with an axe, protecting his companions and trying to heal Lyra in the middle of the fray.
*   **Kleiton** and **Jimmy** fire from their positions, managing to burn and wound several enemies.
*   **Karim** is knocked down but continues to fire.
After an intense firefight and struggle, they manage to kill or drive away the remaining creatures.

### Rescue and Arrival at Port
**PCs present:** Lyra Vance, Jimmy, Kleiton, Yankee Fu, Den (Nemo).
**NPCs present:** Port Authority personnel.
**Location(s):** Open area in the jungle and Downport (Planet Marduk).
**Ship(s):** Rescue Shuttle (Model unknown, Port Authority).

**Scene summary:**
Jimmy manages to contact the rescue shuttle, which instructs them to move to an open area for landing. The group runs towards the extraction point, leaving the ruins behind. Once on board, the pilot is surprised by the mention of native inhabitants on the continent. The group is transported to Marduk's Downport, where they receive medical attention. Den (Nemo) suggests organizing a dinner for the survivors, while Jimmy remembers that they need to look for their contact, Jonny Belen, in the port's underbelly. Finan mentions his intention to claim legal compensation against Oghma.
