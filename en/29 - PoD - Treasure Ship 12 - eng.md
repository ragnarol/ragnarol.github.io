# Session Title: The Great Heist: The Capture of the Martin II

**Player Characters Present:**
*   **Nemo:** Captain and leader of the group.
*   **Paloma:** Hacker and pilot.
*   **Jimmy:** Marine and in charge of security/interrogations.
*   **Emilio (Pika):** Astrogator and medic.
*   **Fermín:** Close combat fighter (brawler).
*   **Fomega (Juan/Alvarito):** Engineer and medic.

**Non-Player Characters Present:**
*   **Captain Torsa:** Imperial Captain of the *Martin II*. Arrogant, loyal to the Empire, despises pirates.
*   **Mariagat (Lady Mariel?):** Second-in-command of the *Martin II*. Competent, described as a "Mary Sue" (perfect), severely wounded by Nemo.
*   **Chris (Krrsh):** Aslan pirate, ally of the PCs. Fierce and loyal.
*   **Henshaw:** Pilot deceived by the PCs, believes they are going to Exe.
*   **Osha:** Astrogator of the *Martin II*, blackmailed due to her genetics.
*   **Purser Boggan:** Logistics officer, corrupt and a forger.
*   **Marine Commander Hark:** Combat cyborg, in charge of security.
*   **Crewman Ealing:** Carefree mechanic.

**Major Developments in the PCs' Lives or the Campaign:**
*   The PCs have succeeded in capturing the **Martin II**, an imperial treasure ship, fulfilling a major objective to obtain resources and glory (and potentially for King Oleb XVI).
*   They have recovered the treasure of Drinax that was in the hold (previously stolen merchandise).
*   A high-level political conspiracy has been discovered: a fake, imperially sealed treaty designed to provoke a war between the Empire and the Aslan by ceding border territories.

**Loose Ends:**
*   **The fate of the prisoners:** The group debates whether to execute them to leave no witnesses (suggested by Jimmy) or keep them alive (Nemo and Fomega). Mariagat has survived thanks to Fomega's surgery.
*   **The mysterious device:** Osha installed a strange device on the navigation console on orders from third parties, whose exact purpose is unknown, except that it collects data and was to be delivered to Tech-World.
*   **Henshaw:** Still believes they are going to Exe, but the ship has jumped to Blue. Her reaction upon discovering the deception is pending.
*   **Pursuit:** Escort ships (Gazelles) attacked during the jump; it is unknown if they can track the jump to Blue.

## Scene 1: Infiltration and Silence
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Paloma, Jimmy, Emilio, Fermín, Fomega.
**NPCs Present:** Henshaw (Pilot), Chris (Aslan Pirate).
**Location:** Shuttle / Engine Room of the Martin II (The World System).
**Ships:** Shuttle (Docked), Martin II (Imperial Treasure Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
The group prepares to board the *Martin II* from their shuttle. Nemo gives a motivating speech promising glory and riches, appealing to loyalty to Drinax (or greed). Paloma performs intensive cyberattacks (*hacking*) for hours to control cameras and doors, gaining access. The group divides: a stealth team advances first. They have trouble with some doors requiring access cards, so they take the card from pilot Henshaw. They move through the engine room, avoiding being seen by the crew working on the engines, and manage to outsmart a distracted marine guard and the mechanic Ealing by hiding in the ceiling and behind machinery.

## Scene 2: Chaos on the Command Bridge
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Paloma, Jimmy, Emilio, Fermín, Fomega.
**NPCs Present:** Captain Torsa, Mariagat (Imperial Officer), Marine Commander Hark (Cyborg), Officer Smith, Chris (Aslan Pirate).
**Location:** Command Bridge and Corridors of the Martin II (The World System).
**Ships:** Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
Just as the group positions themselves to assault the bridge and armory, the general attack alarm sounds. Paloma forces the bridge door, revealing the crew arming themselves. Commander Hark (a cyborg) attacks Fermín in close combat. A firefight erupts: Paloma throws an EMP grenade that temporarily disables electronics (including the PCs' suits and the cyborg's arm). Fermín and the group take down the cyborg. Nemo shoots Mariagat (who was trying to arm the captain) with a laser pistol, leaving her severely wounded. Chris and Fomega secure the rear, eliminating a marine exiting an elevator. Jimmy intimidates Captain Torsa by aiming a shotgun at him, achieving the surrender of the ship due to the attackers' tactical superiority.

## Scene 3: Jump Under Fire
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Paloma, Jimmy, Emilio, Fermín, Fomega.
**NPCs Present:** Captain Torsa.
**Location:** Command Bridge of the Martin II / Space (The World System).
**Ships:** Martin II, Banshee (Harrier, PCs' escort), Imperial Gazelles (Enemy escort ships).

**Scene Summary:**
With the bridge taken, the group realizes that two imperial escort ships (Gazelle class) are attacking. One pursues the *Banshee* and the other fires on the *Martin II*. Paloma takes the helm, attempting to dodge enemy fire while Emilio makes hasty astrogation calculations under pressure. Fomega runs to engineering to manage the jump drive, where the original crew suffers from radiation. Despite damage to sensors and the hull, they manage to coordinate the jump to hyperspace just in time, leaving the imperial ships behind and heading for the Blue system.

## Scene 4: Secrets and Scalpel in Hyperspace
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Paloma, Jimmy, Emilio, Fomega.
**NPCs Present:** Osha (Astrogator), Purser Boggan (Logistics), Mariagat (Wounded), Captain Torsa.
**Location:** Interior of the Martin II (Hyperspace, en route to Blue).
**Ships:** Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
During the week-long jump, the group manages the prisoners. Fomega performs emergency surgery on Mariagat, saving her life (and morbidly joking about stealing a kidney), hoping to use her as a bargaining chip or out of respect for her competence. Jimmy and Nemo interrogate key crew members. They discover that Osha was bribed to install a data collection device on the navigation. More seriously, through torture/intimidation of Officer Boggan, they discover a forged document with high-tech imperial seals: a fake treaty designed to allow the Aslan to conquer border sectors, which would provoke total war. The group debates the ethics of eliminating the entire crew to cover their tracks or keeping them as hostages.
