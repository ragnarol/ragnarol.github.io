### Preparations at Court and Legalization
**PCs present:** Goran, Pika, PJ of Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Juan (GM), Megar (Courtier with artistic aspirations/Documentarian).
**Location:** Floating Palace (Drinax).
**Ships:** *Maui* (Aslan ship, legalized).

The group manages the bureaucracy to legalize the stolen Aslan ship, now named *Maui*, declaring it war booty from the Ihatei attacks. While planning the diplomatic route, Pika contacts **Megar**, a courtier fond of recordings, to produce war propaganda and document Drinax's efforts to boost the kingdom's morale and reputation. A local pilot, spurned after a breakup, is hired to fly the *Maui*.

### Cold Reception at the Port
**PCs present:** Goran, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Provosts of Torpol, Provost Shala (Local leader/Scientist).
**Location:** Torpol (Torpol System).
**Ships:** *Talassa* (Former imperial cruiser without a jump drive, used as static defense).

The PCs travel to **Torpol** seeking a military alliance. The Provosts, living in a bubble of security thanks to their orbital cruiser, are indifferent to the Aslan threat, considering it an external problem. They refuse to offer direct military aid, though they grant credit lines with unfavorable interest rates. Provost Shala hints that she could influence the others if Drinax helps repair the *Talassa*'s jump drive (an unfeasible cost of 6,000 MCr). Goran and Pika decide not to commit and depart with almost empty hands.

### Old Comrades and Black Operations
**PCs present:** Goran, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Psychopomps (Religious leaders/Guides of the dead), Bogdan Stulik (Veteran mercenary, former officer, Ally of Goran).
**Location:** Clarke (Clarke System), Local Bar (Gothic/Symphonic Metal atmosphere).

In **Clarke**, the reception is much warmer. The religious leaders (Psychopomps) fear the Aslan and agree to establish military communications and support Drinax. Goran meets with his old ally, **Bogdan Stulik**. Stulik, now the leader of a small elite commando, offers information about **Cordan**, a world divided by warlords where military support could be obtained by breaking the *status quo*. Goran hires Bogdan (for 2 MCr after a discount for friendship) for a covert operation: to kidnap the scientist from Torpol and bring her to Drinax to force that system's collaboration in the future.

### The War Council and the Fleet Division
**PCs present:** Goran, Pika, Yankee Foo, PJ of Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Princess Rao, Lyra, Korven, Clayton (Crew of *The Ginger*).
**Location:** Meeting Room (Drinax).
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Fleet ship), *Imperatrix* (Battleship under repair).

Back in Drinax, the group meets with **Princess Rao** and the crew of the ship *The Ginger*. Advances are reported: the *Imperatrix* is being armed with particle barbettes and modified cargo bays for fighters. After debating options (including the risky idea of hiring mercenaries from the Glorious Empire or using stolen commercial data to pressure **Blue**), it is decided to split forces to cover more ground:
1.  **Northern Group:** The crew of *The Ginger* (with Paloma/NPCs) will go to **Blue** to negotiate the purchase of fighters (using a Broker) and possibly to **Cordan**.
2.  **Southern Group:** Goran, Pika, and PJ of Nemo will take the *Maui* towards **Paal** and **Byrni**. In Paal they will attempt diplomacy (perhaps offering scientists) and in Byrni they will try to convince the paladins that King Oleb is the legitimate heir to the Sindal Empire.
