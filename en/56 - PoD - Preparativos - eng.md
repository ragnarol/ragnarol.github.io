# Session Title: Seeds of Rebellion and Echoes of Sindal

**PCs present:**
*   **Cordan Group:** Paloma's character (Merchant/Face), Goran, Kleiton, Alvarito (Mentioned).
*   **Drinax Group:** Fénix Corbin/Nemo, Yankee/Nacho, Pika/Emilio.

**NPCs present:**
*   Baroness Lux (Local ruler in Cordan).
*   Yusef Fusagraki (Target, corrupt tax collector).
*   Karin (PCs' crew member).
*   Rachando (Merchant in the Floating Palace).
*   Bri Tolariz (Hawk Guard Commander).
*   King Oleb XVI (King of Drinax).
*   Lady Hil (Courtesan/Administrator, manages protocol).
*   Alfredo (Local with a personal vendetta).
*   Captain Gawain (Mentioned, captain of the *Torpol's Star*).

**Main Developments:**
*   **Cordan Group:** An operations base has been established in Baroness Lux's territory, and a social agitation campaign has been launched in Elaton and surrounding villages to provoke an uprising against the tax collector Yusef Fusagraki, with the ultimate goal of eliminating him without direct implication.
*   **Drinax Group:** Diplomatic preparations have been finalized for King Oleb's reception of the *Torpol's Star* crew, ensuring a brief and formal meeting by presenting Sindal medals. Concurrently, a tactical operation has begun on the planet's surface ("The World") to assault a protected underground complex.

**Loose Ends:**
*   The assault on the underground complex on Drinax's surface is about to begin; the group is positioned but has not yet entered.
*   The social ambush against Yusef in Cordan is in the preparation phase; it remains to be seen if the mob will react violently when the tax collector reaches the final villages on his route.
*   The outcome of the meeting between King Oleb and Captain Gawain while the PCs are on a mission is yet to be confirmed.

### Scene: Infiltration in Border Territory
**PCs present:** Paloma's character, Goran, Kleiton.
**NPCs present:** Baroness Lux (Local ruler), Yusef Fusagraki (Mentioned, target for elimination).
**Location:** Baroness Lux's Palace and the city of Elaton (Planet Cordan).
**Ships mentioned:** *The Ginger* (PCs' ship).

**Scene Summary:**
The group is in Baroness Lux's territory. They receive information about the target, Yusef Fusagraki, a corrupt tax collector operating in the disputed area between Baron Halley and Baron Fero, especially around the fortified city of Elaton. The PCs decide to leave the ship *The Ginger* hidden in Baron Fero's territory and access Elaton in a ground vehicle (jeep), posing as Free Traders. For six days, they integrate into the community, selling goods and gauging the atmosphere, discovering that while there is general discontent and rumors of Yusef blackmailing Baron Halley, there is no organized resistance specifically against him.

### Scene: Logistics and Diplomacy in the Floating Palace
**PCs present:** Fénix Corbin (Nemo), Yankee (Nacho), Pika (Emilio).
**NPCs present:** Rachando (Bazaar merchant, acquires rare items), Bri Tolariz (Hawk Guard Leader, loyal but strict), King Oleb XVI (Eccentric and nostalgic monarch), Lady Hil (Court organizer).
**Location:** Floating Palace (Planet Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** *Torpol's Star* (Mentioned, Captain Gawain).

**Scene Summary:**
While preparations for the surface assault are underway, the PCs conduct business at the palace. Yankee visits Rachando and acquires an optical/thermal camouflage suit and a heavy laser rifle. Fénix attempts, unsuccessfully, to recruit members of the Hawk Guard by speaking with Bri Tolariz, who declines due to his men's lack of specific training for the mission. Subsequently, Fénix and Pika coordinate with Lady Hil and King Oleb for the diplomatic reception of Captain Gawain and his crew (arriving from Byrni). Fénix persuades the King to hold a brief ceremony, presenting medals from the old Sindal Empire to satisfy the visitors' ego without risking Oleb speaking too much or causing diplomatic incidents. The reception appears to go well under Lady Hil's supervision.

### Scene: Reconnaissance in the Ruins
**PCs present:** Fénix Corbin (Nemo), Yankee (Nacho), Pika (Emilio).
**NPCs present:** Vespexer squad (Surface explorers, allied mercenaries).
**Location:** Ruins on the surface, bunker area (Planet Drinax/The World).
**Ships mentioned:** Aslan Scout Ship (Scout 100-ton model, parked on the surface).

**Scene Summary:**
The team descends to the devastated surface of Drinax with a group of allied Vespexers. They approach the coordinates of the target underground complex, hiding their vehicle in some ruins. Pika uses a drone to conduct aerial reconnaissance by chaining sensor systems. They discover that the complex is enormous (one square kilometer) and has a main entrance with power, protected by drones and where an Aslan Scout ship is parked. They also locate several secondary entrances in the form of collapsed tunnels near an old crater. The group decides to infiltrate through the secondary tunnels to avoid the guarded main entrance. Yankee plans to enter with his environmental protection suit and switch to the stealth suit once inside, while Pika debates whether to stay outside to maintain communications or enter with the group.

### Scene: Sowing Discord on Yusef's Route
**PCs present:** Paloma's character, Goran.
**NPCs present:** Alfredo (Local of Fero ethnicity, victim of Yusef), Karin (Crew member, stays on communications).
**Location:** Elaton and rural villages along the collection route (Planet Cordan).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Back on Cordan, after failing to find a radical group willing to kill Yusef in Elaton, Paloma's character locates Alfredo, a man with a personal vendetta against the tax collector. Upon learning that Yusef's tax collection route begins in a week, the group changes strategy. They travel by jeep to the rural villages Yusef will visit at the end of his tour. There, they use their cover as merchants to spread rumors and inflame the atmosphere, telling stories (real or exaggerated) about abuses committed by Yusef in previous villages. The goal is to incite a violent mob or "demonstration" that gets out of hand when Yusef arrives, allowing the PCs to act or eliminate him amidst the chaos without being directly identified as killers. Goran prepares the ground tactically (possible barricades, sniper points) while Paloma socially manipulates the locals.
