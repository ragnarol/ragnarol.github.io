They have established a work routine to observe the security systems and have rented a nearby industrial ship as a safe house. Additionally, they have discovered there is a 22,000 credit reward for information about their own ship (described as an unknown ship with a particle cannon and a portrait of a human) following their previous incident with Aslan merchants.

**Loose ends:**
*   The exact content and opening mechanism of *The Vault* remain a mystery, although Pika has confirmed it is autonomous but connected to the ship.
*   The Commander of the Marines, Hark, openly suspects Rocío after the interrogation at dinner.
*   The presence of the pirate Aslan "Iron Tooth" has been confirmed in the Exe system by Captain Bell.
*   The nature of the television program "Foresters" recorded on the planet and its relationship with the Empire.

**Scene Summary:**
The group splits up. Emilio, Rocío, and Pika begin their work infiltration on the *Martin II*. They pass security checks (without their own weapons or tools) and are assigned shifts: Emilio and Pika in the morning with the superstitious Polo; Rocío in the afternoon with Thalys. The engineering area is a mess with human remains and hydrogen damage. From the galley, they observe The Vault, built with exotic materials.
Meanwhile, outside the ship, Nemo and Juan try to establish an operational base. Nemo manages to rent a discreet industrial ship through bribes and administration, while Juan unsuccessfully attempts to contact local terrorist groups.

Nemo socializes at the bar to gather information and establish his mercenary alibi. He meets Joral and Gila, an older merchant couple who trade in the Borderlands.

On the second day, Rocío is pulled from her shift, dirty and covered in grease, by Commander Yagat to dine with the ship's senior staff. It's a social ambush. Captain Torsa is classist and nepotistic. Commander Hark, an intimidating cyborg, subjects Rocío to an aggressive interrogation about her past after leaving the navy. Rocío tries to maintain composure by lying about her record, but awakens Hark's suspicions. She learns that Halvinar will remain on the planet after repairs to finalize paperwork.

**Location:** Engineering (Martin II), Arunisiir City.

**Scene Summary:**
On the third day, Pika takes advantage of a camera blind spot and the distraction of the marines to hack a terminal. She accesses the accident logs, confirming it was a failure in the jump drive's security locks that released 500 tons of hydrogen, killing the original engineering crew. She finds no definitive proof of prior sabotage but confirms the computer security is standard.
Emilio tries to socialize with pilot Henshaw without much initial success, and attempts to provoke a "fortuitous" accident by dirtying the immaculate Marine Sharif to test his reaction, failing spectacularly.
Outside, Juan investigates in the city and discovers a television program called "Foresters" produced by an imperial corporation on the planet.

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo intervenes in a dispute between Captain Bell and a local Aslan demanding a "tax" for landing on his ancestral territory. Nemo uses diplomacy and manipulates the Aslan by appealing to his honor, causing him to withdraw. Grateful, Bell tells him that four weeks ago her sensors detected the famous Aslan pirate "Iron Tooth" and his ship *Midgrinder* in the Exe asteroid belt. Nemo tries to sell her "legal" (stolen) merchandise, but she declines, preferring to stay within the law. Additionally, Nemo learns about the 22,000 credit reward offered for information about the PCs' ship.
