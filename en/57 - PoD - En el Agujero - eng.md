## Exploration of the Communications Level
**PCs present:** Yankee, Corven, Pika, Dora
**NPCs present:** Scout, Guy 1, Guy 2, Sharpshooter (Vespexers - Wasteland survivors)
**Location:** Ancient Planetary Defense Base (Planet Drinax)
**Ships:** None

**Scene Summary**
The group parks their ground vehicle near the defenses and enters the facility by forcing an unguarded entrance. They split into teams to explore the first underground level (communications). They discover that the area is in ruins, looted, and without power. During the search, Corven finds a relic: a double-barreled syndalite officer's revolver in perfect condition. Dora and Yankee are accidentally exposed to a high-radiation area and suffer poisoning, having to withdraw temporarily for treatment.

## Collapses and Dangerous Connections
**PCs present:** Pika, Corven, Yankee, Dora
**NPCs present:** Sharpshooter, Scout (Vespexer - Guide)
**Location:** Crater access and Level 1 (Planet Drinax)
**Ships:** None

**Scene Summary**
The next day, they attempt to enter through a cratered area. The structure is unstable; Pika and the Sharpshooter get trapped under a rubble collapse, suffering injuries, but are rescued by the group. Corven detects a nest of Drinaxian red ants (highly venomous insects) and they manage to avoid it. They decide to try and hack the system from Level 1. Pika performs a risky wire splice in a radioactive area to power a console, suffering more radiation. Yankee attempts to hack the system with Pika's help, gaining limited access: they confirm that there are active sensors and encrypted communications leaving the base.

## Encounter with Automated Security
**PCs present:** Corven
**NPCs present:** Alex, Tropex (Vespexers - Young recruits)
**Location:** Level 3 - Barracks (Planet Drinax)
**Ships:** None

**Scene Summary**
Corven descends to the third level (Barracks) with two recruits. This area is in better condition. Suddenly, they are surprised by an ancient security droid that camouflages itself as a noble table but possesses an energy cannon. Combat begins: the droid fires, missing its shot, and Corven responds with automatic fire from his assault rifle, destroying the robot. The recruits collect the droid's remains as war loot.

## Yankee's Accident and the Withdrawal
**PCs present:** Yankee, Pika, Corven
**NPCs present:** None directly in Yankee's action
**Location:** Access to deep levels and Vehicle (Planet Drinax)
**Ships:** None

**Scene Summary**
While Pika stays decrypting communications (discovering after many hours that they are periodic "all clear" messages), Yankee uses his invisibility cloak to attempt a stealthy infiltration towards the active lower levels. While trying to force a locked door, he receives a massive electrical shock that leaves him severely injured. Seriously wounded and having confirmed that direct access is dangerous, Yankee returns to the group. Corven provides first aid, and they decide to abort the mission temporarily, returning to the vehicle so Yankee can recover in the onboard infirmary.
