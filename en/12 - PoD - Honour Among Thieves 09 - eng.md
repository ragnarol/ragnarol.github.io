*   A diplomatic path has been opened to annex **Clarke** to the Kingdom, but with a difficult religious condition: Prince Harrik must accept and promote the faith of "The Cure" (technological resurrection).
*   The crew has obtained a substantial reward (approx. 2.5 million credits) which stabilizes the ship's finances and allows for tribute to be paid to King Oleb.
*   Materials (20 tons of raw materials) have been acquired to repair and beautify the ship, improving its status.

**Loose Ends:**
*   The beacon of the "Proactive Recycling Company": What is this corporation and why do they recycle old ships?
*   The alien corpse: Fomega has kept it for study (possibly the "Cockroach" mentioned at the end).
*   Clarke's condition: Will Prince Harrik agree to convert to a funeral religion to gain an ally?
*   The contact in Exocet (pirate who gave the ingot) remains pending.
*   Station mysteries: The recordings about "the ghost" and the voice on the radio were not thoroughly investigated.

### Scene 1: The Trap and the Boarding
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fomega, Jimmy, Paloma (from the ship).
**NPCs present:** Chris and Honor (Support crew), The Bug (Xenobiological monster, spits acid, stealthy).
**Location:** Ancient Space Station (Unknown system, orbit of a gas giant).
**Ships:** Banshee (Harrier Class, Captain Nemo).

**Summary:**
The crew discusses how to deal with a dangerous alien creature inhabiting an ancient space station where they plan to refuel. Fomega designs an elaborate trap using a box, a vacuum suit with active communications, and meat as bait, hoping to electrocute or capture the beast. After a day of waiting with no results, Nemo orders a direct boarding.
Nemo, Jimmy, Fomega, and the NPCs enter the station in zero gravity. They find a grim environment with remnants of resin and shell casings. Jimmy uses a device ("bug") to monitor their rear. Upon reaching a control room, the creature ambushes Jimmy from the darkness. Jimmy fires his shotgun but misses; Nemo reacts quickly and kills the beast with a precise laser rifle shot to the head.
After the combat, they loot the station, recovering a huge and valuable painting of an ancient Sindal Emperor and a memory card. Fomega takes the alien corpse for study. Paloma hacks a nearby beacon, discovering it belongs to the "Proactive Recycling Company".

### Scene 2: Business on Borite
**PCs present:** Paloma, Nemo, Fomega, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** Local merchant (Seller of scrap and supplies).
**Location:** Borite City and Spaceport (Planet Borite).

**Summary:**
The Banshee lands on Borite. Taking advantage of the stay, Paloma contacts a local merchant. They sell the scrap obtained from the station. Paloma strikes a great deal (thanks to an excellent Broker roll and the planet's characteristics) to buy 20 tons of "Common Raw Materials" at half price. The goal is to use these materials to repair and aesthetically improve the ship's hull in the future. The purchase of luxury liquors is discarded due to a temporary lack of funds and the difficulty of trading Borite's agricultural goods off-world.

### Scene 3: The Delivery on Torpol
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Provost Falx (Leader of Torpol, grateful and formal).
**Location:** Torpol (Aquatic Planet).

**Summary:**
The crew arrives at Torpol to deliver the prisoner Ferrik, captured in previous sessions. They meet with Provost Falx. To protect the location of the secret fuel depot they discovered, they lie about where they captured Ferrik, claiming it was on a moon of Borite or on Asis. Falx accepts the story and informs them that there will be a joint trial with Clarke's authorities. The group's reputation on Torpol improves considerably.

### Scene 4: The Tomb World
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Guardian Malos (Psychopomp, carries freezing equipment), High Psychopomp Boone (Religious leader, fanatic of "The Cure").
**Location:** Clarke (Cemetery/Industrial Planet, grim and radioactive atmosphere).

**Summary:**
They travel to the Clarke system, a desolate world covered in tombs and black pyramids. The local culture revolves around freezing the dying (in carbonite/black crystal) in anticipation of future resurrection technology. They deliver Ferrik, who is sentenced to be frozen alive and placed in orbit as an eternal warning.
High Psychopomp Boone requests an audience. He offers a formal alliance with Drinax, but with one condition: he has heard that Prince Harrik possesses "The Cure" (or the path to it) and demands that the Prince declare his faith in their religion and make it the official religion of Drinax.
Paloma takes the opportunity to buy 60 tons of wood (although they can only load 40) and refuel. The relationship with Clarke becomes friendly.

### Scene 5: Return to the Floating Palace
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (Mentioned), Drinax Falcon Guard (Patrol ship).
**Location:** Drinax (Floating Palace).

**Summary:**
The Banshee returns to Drinax with full pockets (rewards from Clarke and Torpol plus the bounty on Ferrik's head). Debts to King Oleb are settled, and downtime is planned. The characters decide to use the free time and travels to train skills and improve the ship. It is mentioned that they must decide what to do with the loot and whether to give a portion to the NPC crewmember Miria.
