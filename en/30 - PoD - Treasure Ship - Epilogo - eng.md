# The Imperial Loot and the Return to Drinax

**PCs present:**
*   Captain James Ondo / Nemo
*   Emilio (Scholar/Astrographer)
*   Paloma (Pilot)
*   Rocío (Engineer)
*   Jimmy (Marine/Spy - Retires at the end of the session)
*   Fermín (Marine/Bodyguard)
*   Pika (Diplomat/Noble)

**NPCs present:**
*   **Chris** (Vargr, loyal and enthusiastic crew member).
*   **Alfomega** (Engineer/Astrographer of the Martin II).
*   **Admiral Lord Drax** (Commander of the Drinax Star Guard).
*   **King Oleb XVI** (King of Drinax).
*   **Prince Harrik** (Son of the King, intellectual and measured).
*   **Princess Rao's Servant** (Messenger).
*   **Scholars of the Drinax Tower** (Mentioned).

**Campaign Development:**
*   The group successfully brings the imperial treasure ship *Martin II* to Drinax, completing a major coup against the Empire.
*   The alliance with King Oleb is consolidated after presenting him with the loot.
*   It is decided to donate the hull of the *Martin II* to Lord Drax's fleet to gain political favor and avoid repair costs, with the PCs keeping the cargo and the contents of the vault.
*   Jimmy leaves the active crew to establish an intelligence network and infrastructure on Drinax.

**Loose Ends:**
*   **The Vault:** The scholars of the Tower need a month to decrypt the code and open it.
*   **The Prisoners:** The cargo hold of the *Martin II* is full of imperial prisoners and crew. What to do with them has not been decided (release them in another system or demand ransom).
*   **Rao's Message:** Princess Rao will return in two months, and her servant indicates she has extremely urgent information.
*   **Aslan Document:** There is a document (possibly false) about a treaty between the Empire and the Aslans to divide the sector, which needs to be verified.
*   **Loot Sale:** Time is needed to liquidate the generic cargo on Drinax or neighboring worlds.

### Scene 1: Tension in the Blue System
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Alfomega (Engineer assisting with the engines).
**Location:** Gas Giant and deep space (Blue System).
**Ships:** *Martin II* (Imperial Treasure Ship, Captained by James Ondo/Paloma), *Banshee* (Harrier, Captained by Paloma/Emilio).

**Summary:**
After capturing the *Martin II*, the group arrives in the Blue system. While attempting to repair critical damage to the *Martin II*'s turret, Rocío discovers they lack the correct parts due to the technological difference. They undertake a risky refueling maneuver at the gas giant; Paloma pilots the *Banshee* and helps coordinate the *Martin II*, successfully refueling both ships without initial detection. However, they detect a system defense ship approaching on an intercept course. After an intense debate about whether to jump to empty space (coordinate 2222) or risk a direct jump with the *Martin II*'s damaged jump drive, they decide to split up. The *Martin II* will jump directly to Drinax (risking the engine), and the *Banshee* will take a safe route via Torpol.

### Scene 2: The Jump and the Arrival
**PCs present:** All (divided between two ships).
**NPCs present:** Chris (Vargr).
**Location:** Jump space, Torpol System, and Drinax System.
**Ships:** *Martin II*, *Banshee*.

**Summary:**
The *Martin II* manages to reach Drinax, but the jump drive breaks down irreparably upon arrival, leaving them stranded at the system's edge. Meanwhile, the *Banshee* refuels in Torpol without incident and arrives at Drinax a week later. James Ondo takes the *Martin II*'s shuttle to proceed ahead to the Floating Palace. He contacts Admiral Lord Drax, requesting a discreet docking and an urgent audience with the King, hinting that they bring something "bigger than the King's prick." Drax, intrigued and serious, arranges for a Star Guard escort to take them secretly to the palace.

### Scene 3: Audience with King Oleb
**PCs present:** Captain Ondo, Chris (the "dog").
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (The Hedonistic King, exuberant and vulgar), Admiral Lord Drax (The Loyal Military Man, stoic).
**Location:** Floating Palace (Drinax Planet).

**Summary:**
Ondo finds King Oleb watching a water polo match and scratching his groin. After the bows, Ondo reveals they have stolen an entire imperial treasure ship, complete with crew and cargo. The news causes the King's immediate euphoria, and he demands his Battle Dress to personally inspect the prize. Drax appears skeptical but impressed.

### Scene 4: Inspection and Celebration
**PCs present:** All (reunited after the Banshee's arrival).
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI, Lord Drax, Prince Harrik (The Rebuilt Intellectual, serious and political).
**Location:** Hangar and Officers' Mess of the *Martin II* / Floating Palace (Drinax Planet).
**Ships:** *Martin II*.

**Summary:**
The King and Drax inspect the ship. Oleb becomes excited by the treasure vault, even striking it in frustration at not being able to open it. During the celebration dinner, the group discusses what to do with the ship. Given that Drinax lacks shipyards capable of maintaining a ship of that tonnage and the engine is broken, they decide to gift the hull of the *Martin II* to Lord Drax for system defense, with the PCs keeping the contents.
Later, they have a private meeting with Prince Harrik. Unlike his father, Harrik is measured and pragmatic. Pika informs him about the document found suggesting a pact between the Empire and the Aslans. Harrik advocates for the industrial and commercial development of Drinax rather than the aggressive military conquest preferred by his sister, Princess Rao.

### Scene 5: Farewells and Future Plans
**PCs present:** Jimmy, James Ondo, Pika, Emilio.
**NPCs present:** Princess Rao's Servant.
**Location:** Drinax.

**Summary:**
A messenger from Princess Rao informs them that she will return in two months and has vital information. Jimmy announces his retirement from the active crew of the *Banshee* to focus on building an intelligence network on the ground, introducing a replacement (a marine). Emilio coordinates with the scholars of the Tower on opening the vault, which will take approximately one month. The group prepares for a period of rest ("vacation") and selling merchandise while awaiting the vault's opening and the Princess's return.
