### Scene 1: Forced Landing in the Mountains
**PCs present:** Lyra, Daijiro Yuga.
**NPCs present:** Kleiton (Lyra's pilot, critically injured), Karim (Novice crewmember, seeks revenge for her brother), Margarita (Local healer).
**Location:** Daijiro's cabin, Cordan Mountains (Cordan).
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Light freighter, partially crashed).

**Summary:**
Fleeing an ambush where Goran died, Karim attempts to pilot the *Ginger* without experience and makes a disastrous landing near an isolated cabin. The cabin belongs to Daijiro Yuga, a retired soldier who served with Kleiton years ago during pacification operations in Umemii. Lyra desperately asks for help to save Kleiton. Daijiro seeks out Margarita, a local healer, who manages to stabilize the pilot. During his convalescence, Daijiro and Lyra exchange stories about their situations and the former's "retirement." A small symbolic funeral is held for Goran.

### Scene 2: Encrypted Secrets and War Rumors
**PCs present:** Lyra, Daijiro Yuga.
**NPCs present:** Kleiton, Karim.
**Location:** Daijiro's cabin (Cordan).

**Summary:**
While awaiting Kleiton's recovery, Lyra and Daijiro decrypt the files stolen from Josefus. They discover that Josefus was blackmailing Baron Halley with information about secret allies involved in training his guard, something the Third Empire would disapprove of. Over the radio, they hear news of rising military tension and border skirmishes between Baron Fero and Baron Halley, partly fueled by the PCs' previous actions. They decide to contact Baroness Lux to inform her and coordinate a future meeting, and Daijiro decides to join the crew, leaving his hermit life behind.

### Scene 3: Culture for the Crown
**PCs present:** Corben, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Asma Ozaed (Museum Director), Nicolaos Rosa (Expert in Sindalite military history, wargame geek archetype, heavy smoker).
**Location:** Sindal Museum and Restaurant on Zafen Island (Torpol).
**Ships:** *Maui*.

**Summary:**
Corben and Pika arrive in Torpol looking for an expert who can legitimize King Oleb's claim through history and protocol. After inviting the museum director to lunch, they manage to recruit Nicolaos Rosa, an expert on Sindalite battles and knightly orders. During the return trip, Pika devises a historical narrative based on the planet *Chalchiutlicue* to justify Oleb's rough manners before the Order of Byrni, drawing a parallel with an ancient warrior emperor. They also learn that a more renowned scholar, Professor Yutal Mirobar, is stranded in Dostoevsky, and they leave a message for Captain Jimmy to try and pick him up.

### Scene 4: The Battle for Drinax
**PCs present:** Corben, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Prince Harrik, Lady Hil.
**Location:** Orbit of Drinax and surrounding space.
**Ships:** *Maui* (Damaged in combat), *Imperatrix* (Stolen/camouflaged Imperial ship), Byrni Fleet (Led by an ancient flagship).

**Summary:**
The PCs' fleet returns to Drinax, coinciding with the arrival of reinforcements from the Order of Byrni and ships from Clarke and Blue. There is debate on whether to use the *Imperatrix*, risking a diplomatic incident if its stolen origin is discovered. Corben convinces the group to use it as a demonstration of full force. A week-long space battle erupts against the Aslan (Yatei) pirate blockade. The coalition manages to break the blockade and drive off the enemy ships. The *Maui* suffers damage during combat, but the victory temporarily secures the system.

### Scene 5: Encounter of Two Worlds
**PCs present:** Corben, Pika, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (Gruff but warrior-like), Regent of Byrni, Lady Hil (Organizer, protector of protocol).
**Location:** Royal Palace (Drinax).

**Summary:**
After the battle, Yankee is released from captivity (though he loses his invisibility cloak). Lady Hil organizes a diplomatic meeting between King Oleb and the Regent of Byrni, using the historical narrative prepared by Pika and decorating the palace with specific relics. Although Oleb has some protocol gaffes (including burps), his warrior spirit connects with the paladins of Byrni. No definitive treaty is signed, but Oleb is invited to visit Byrni, which is considered a diplomatic success and a step towards the recognition of his imperial title.
