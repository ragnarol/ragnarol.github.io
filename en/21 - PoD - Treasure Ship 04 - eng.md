# Session: Infiltrators in Arunisiir

**PJs present:** Fomega, Nemo, Paloma (also referred to as Pika), Juan Maldonado, Honor (Emilio), Rocío, Nacho (mentioned), Tía (mentioned).
**NPCs present:** Captain Hark (Marine Leader), Commander Maria Gad (Second-in-command of the Martin II), Jane Laral (Marine tourist), Salvestes (Tough Marine), Crewmember O'Leary (Logistics), Crewmember Ealing (Logistics), Amparo (Tech-World merchant), Officer Grimsvold (Tactical Officer), Pilot Henshaw.

**Important developments in the lives of the PJs or the campaign:**
*   The group consolidates their position as temporary workers aboard the ship *Martin II*, gaining the crew's trust (or indifference).
*   A concrete plan is established to introduce a hacking computer onto the ship: dismantling it and smuggling it through supply boxes, taking advantage of the logistics managers' apathy.
*   Discovery of a potential information buyer or spy (Amparo) interested in the status of the *Martin II*'s jump drive.

**Loose ends / Pending:**
*   **The Vault:** They still don't know what's inside or exactly how to open it (suspected physical key, DNA, and astrophysical coordinates).
*   **The ship's health status:** Captain Hark is discreetly looking for a doctor in the city, which is unusual.
*   **Amparo:** It's unknown if they are a simple opportunist, an imperial spy, or an agent of another faction.
*   **The computer:** The introduction of the computer parts into the supplies and their assembly onboard without detection still needs to be executed.
*   **The ship Banshee:** It remains hidden far away, and moving it to the spaceport involves risks of detection by the orbiting Gazelle.

### Scene 1: Recalling the Mission and the Plan
**PJs present:** Fomega, Nemo, Paloma, Juan Maldonado, Honor (Emilio).
**NPCs present:** None direct, the crew of the *Martin II* is mentioned.
**Location:** Hideout/Garage in the city (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** Martin II (Imperial Treasure Ship), Banshee (PJs' Ship), Gazelle (Gazelle Class, escort ship in orbit), Meet Grinder (Pocket Warship Aslan, Captain Joral Iron Tooth).

**Scene Summary:**
The group recalls their current situation: they are on planet Arunisiir, where the imperial treasure ship *Martin II* (about 1200 tons) made an emergency landing after a hydrogen leak in the jump drive. The outside atmosphere is breathable but high in nitrogen, and a *Gazelle*-class warship is monitoring from orbit.
They discuss the "Vault" on the ship. They know it requires a key, biometrics, and possibly specific navigation coordinates to open. Several strategies are debated:
1.  Hack the ship by introducing a powerful computer.
2.  Cause a mass food poisoning to incapacitate the crew (idea of using laxatives or contaminating the food processor).
3.  Simulate an emergency/drill to move the crew.
4.  Nemo suggests "eliminating" some marines to reduce security, but Juan advocates for maintaining a low profile and investigating further before using violence.
Finally, they decide that the priority is to introduce Paloma's computer to hack the systems and obtain information about the Vault. They plan to do this by smuggling the parts inside legitimate supply boxes.

### Scene 2: Morning Shift - Socializing with the Enemy
**PJs present:** Fomega, Honor (Emilio).
**NPCs present:** Marine Salvestes (Tough guy), Marine Jane Laral (Tourist, curious).
**Location:** Mess Hall / Cantina of the ship *Martin II* (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
During their work shift on the ship, Fomega uses mealtime to try and socialize. They sit with marines Salvestes and Jane Laral. Fomega pretends to be a local from the planet *Blue* to justify their presence. The conversation is innocuous but serves to establish a cordial relationship and make them stop seeing them as suspicious strangers.
Meanwhile, Honor (Emilio) tries to get close to the Vault area in the cargo hold to investigate it, but discovers it's a common thoroughfare with people always stretching their legs or standing guard, so they can't get close enough without raising suspicion.

### Scene 3: Afternoon Shift - Plumbing and Logistics
**PJs present:** Paloma (Pika), Rocío, Tía.
**NPCs present:** Crewmember O'Leary (Logistics, drunk, lazy), Crewmember Ealing (Logistics, drunk, lazy).
**Location:** Engineering / Pipe system of the ship *Martin II* (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
Paloma and her team are assigned an unpleasant task: checking the sewage pipes at the order of Officer Grimsvold. Taking advantage of working near the cargo and supply area, Paloma observes the goods entry procedure.
She discovers that the managers, O'Leary and Ealing, are lazy, tired of military discipline, and prefer playing cards over meticulously checking boxes. Paloma uses her social skills to extract information from them about the local supplier from whom they pick up merchandise the next day. This confirms that it is viable to smugmoogle the computer parts in these boxes through bribery or external manipulation.

### Scene 4: An Indecent Proposal
**PJs present:** Fomega, Honor (Emilio).
**NPCs present:** Amparo (Tech-World merchant, cyberpunk appearance, wears a wafer jack on their head).
**Location:** Spaceport Bar (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** Hopeful Wanderer (Ship Amparo arrived on), Martin II.

**Scene Summary:**
As the shift ends, a stranger approaches Fomega and Honor. They introduce themselves as Amparo, a merchant of rare parts who has arrived from *Tech-World*. They have a distinctive technological appearance.
Amparo invites them for a beer and offers them money (1,000 credits each) in exchange for truthful information about the *Martin II*'s condition, specifically confirmation that the jump drive is inoperative. The PJs accept the money and confirm the information, though they suspect Amparo's intentions, as Amparo records the conversation in their cranial implant. Amparo claims to want to sell parts to the Empire, but their demeanor is suspicious.

### Scene 5: The Search for the Supplier
**PJs present:** Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Captain Hark (Mentioned).
**Location:** City / Cantinas (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo spends their day gathering rumors and preparing the ground for the computer plan.
They learn of an unsettling rumor: the Marine Commander, Hark, has been inquiring about the availability of competent doctors in the city, though it's unknown for whom or for what purpose.
Later, Paloma informs Nemo about the identity of the ship's supply provider. Nemo decides they will go look for this provider (or their shop) to try and manipulate the next day's shipment and introduce the hacking computer parts.
