# Session Title: Nuclear Supplies and Viral Propaganda

**PCs present:**
*   **Nemo:** Captain of the Banshee.
*   **Goran:** Mercenary and brute force (Player: Nacho).
*   **Abra / "Fomega":** Technology and communications specialist (Player: Emilio).
*   **Alvarito / Jane:** Navigator and driver (Player: Álvaro).

**NPCs present:**
*   **Juan:** The Arbiter (GM).
*   **Paloma:** Smuggler ally, captain of her own ship.
*   **Kaisil:** Pilot and Paloma's partner.
*   **Utea:** Aslan merchant in Kteiroa, ally.
*   **Saldancet:** Merchant (mentioned), transported the frozen bodies.
*   **King Oleb XVI, Lady Hil, Admiral Darokin:** (Not actively present, part of the background).

**Main developments in PCs' lives or the campaign:**
*   The **Imperial Armada** has placed a bounty on the heads of the Banshee's crew (100,000 credits) after finding the frozen bodies in Hilfer and linking the ship's stealth technology to the disappearance of the *Martin*.
*   It has been possible to delay and partially demoralize the Aslan troops in Kteiroa through a "fake news" operation.
*   A shipment of weapons (including nuclear ones) has been delivered to the losing faction in Acoaft to prolong the civil war and prevent the winning fleet from heading to Drinax.

**Loose ends:**
*   **The Vespexers:** It has been discovered that humans (possibly the Vespexer mercenaries) are being held on Tiuk's freighter in Kteiroa, fed cheap human food.
*   **Judge Yae:** "Plan C" involves assassinating the war arbiter in Acoaft, Judge Yae, to prevent him from declaring the end of the conflict if the supplies are ineffective.
*   **Abra's Identity:** Abra left an identification card (or tool) when sabotaging the communications tower; Utea knows this, although she has covered it up.

## Scene: Stalemate in Kteiroa
**PCs present:** Goran, Abra.
**NPCs present:** Old Eliu (Aslan Leader, hates humans), Tiuk (Aslan Leader, "The Influencer", wants to conquer Drinax).
**Location:** Kteiroa (Kteiroa System).
**Ships:** None specifically mentioned in action.

**Scene Summary:**
During weeks 17 and 18, Goran and Abra attempt political maneuvering in Kteiroa with little success. It is confirmed that the plan to divert the Aslan fleet towards the *Fantasy* system has failed because Old Eliu refuses, considering *Fantasy* a worthless place compared to the spoils of Drinax. Goran tries to offer himself as a mercenary but is rejected for being human. Abra tries to extract information from some Aslan females but ends up drunk and without useful data. It is confirmed that Tiuk has a force of about 10 young males in combat armor and several female engineers distributed across three ships (two scouts and one freighter).

## Scene: Intelligence and Shopping in Pal
**PCs present:** Nemo, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Local Aslan merchants.
**Location:** Pal (Pal System), Spaceport.
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Merchant Corvette, Captain Nemo).

**Scene Summary:**
Meanwhile, Nemo and Alvarito spend time in Pal preparing for the trip to Acoaft. Alvarito buys survival equipment (environment suits) and maps, as Acoaft has a corrosive atmosphere. Nemo uses his social skills and trade in spices (and holographic pornography) to infiltrate among the Aslan at the port. He discovers crucial information: the war in Acoaft will end in about 10 weeks with the victory of Drinax's enemies; there is an orbital blockade of 800-ton interceptors; and Judge Yae plans to leave for Keia soon to announce the winner. They also receive a message from Saldancet warning that the Empire is looking for a ship with stealth and has placed a bounty of 100,000 credits.

## Scene: The Viral Video
**PCs present:** Goran, Abra.
**NPCs present:** Utea (Aslan Merchant).
**Location:** Kteiroa (Kteiroa System), Spaceport.
**Ships:** Tiuk's fleet ships (mentioned in orbit).

**Scene Summary:**
In week 19, Goran and Abra execute a media sabotage plan. Goran reconnoiters the spaceport to find the "community video" transmission room. Abra, with the help of Goran's surveillance, infiltrates by forcing the lock (leaving an identification card by mistake) and hacks the system to broadcast a previously created fake video (deepfake). The video causes chaos and duels among the Aslan, damaging the morale of Tiuk's and Eliu's troops and causing some desertions, although it doesn't completely stop their plans. Utea scolds Abra for breaking the door but seems amused by the outcome. Additionally, Goran discovers that Tiuk's women are buying food for humans, deducing they have prisoners (the Vespexers) on their freighter.

## Scene: Breaking the Blockade
**PCs present:** Nemo, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Paloma (Smuggler), Kaisil (Pilot).
**Location:** The World, Borito, Orbit of Acoaft (Acoaft System).
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Merchant Corvette with stealth), Paloma's Ship (Light Transport).

**Scene Summary:**
The crew of the *Banshee* travels through *The World* to meet Paloma in *Borito* (Week 20). Paloma brings illegal weapons (tactical nuclear bombs) instead of spices. They decide to take Paloma and her cargo on the *Banshee* for the mission. Upon arriving at Acoaft, they use the stealth systems of the *Banshee* and an expert astrogation roll (calculated with the ship's programs and Alvarito's help) to silently slip through the blockade fleet (8 interceptors and battleships) undetected, entering the planet's atmosphere like "a camouflaged rock."

## Scene: Delivery in Hostile Territory
**PCs present:** Nemo, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Aslan Resistance (observed from a distance).
**Location:** Surface of Acoaft (Acoaft System), canyon and trench area.
**Ships:** *Banshee* (hidden with holographic camouflage), Enemy Fighters (patrolling).

**Scene Summary:**
Already on the surface (Week 21), they use passive and active sensors briefly to locate the losing faction, which is surrounded and without supplies. They land in a canyon and use the Jeeps to bring the cargo closer to the front lines. The operation is risky; they are almost detected by enemy patrols and tanks, forcing them to leave the supplies (10 tons of food, 10 tons of advanced weapons, 5 tons of medicine, and 3 tons of nuclear weapons) a bit further than planned and closer to enemy areas. They attempt to leave a misleading message ("Aslan cache recovered") and coordinates, but the execution is clumsy, making the Aslan distrust the origin of the aid. However, access to nuclear weapons gives them a formidable opportunity for resistance ("+3" in conflict resolution). The PCs retreat to wait and consider "Plan C": hunt down the Judge if he tries to leave the planet.
