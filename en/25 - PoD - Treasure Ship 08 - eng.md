### Scene: The Intruder in the Forest
**PCs Present:** Sony (Juan), Fermín (Nacho).
**NPCs Present:** Security Guard (Woman around 50, local to Arunisiir, pragmatic), Krrsh (Crew member, anxious, heir pirate archetype).
**Location:** Dense forest (Arunisiir/System).
**Ships:** Banshee (PCs' Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
Sony and Fermín discover an imperial television film crew setting up dangerously close to where the *Banshee* is hidden. Sony approaches, posing as someone dangerous, and warns the security guard about supposed military operations and "people who don't want to be seen" in the forest. The guard, not wanting trouble for her salary, convinces the director to move the camp the next day. Sony plants hidden microphones (*bugs*) in the camp before leaving. Krrsh appears nervous and suggests moving the ship to orbit, but it is ultimately decided to leave it there under surveillance.

### Scene: Return to the City and Criminal Life

**NPCs Present:** Wolf (Convicted criminal, childish but brutal mindset, loyal thug archetype).
**Location:** Road to the city and City (Arunisiir/System).
**Ships:** N/A.

**Scene Summary:**
Fermín drives the truck back to the city with Wolf as co-pilot. During the journey, Wolf speaks nostalgically about his life in various prisons (like an underwater prison in Blue), prison food, and violence, idealizing criminal life. Fermín treats Wolf with patience, almost like a child, and they spend the day together in the city enjoying rough activities (Monster Trucks) to keep Wolf's morale high.

### Scene: The Million-Credit Deal

**NPCs Present:** Captain Bell (Broker/Trader, interested in business), Fomega (mentioned).
**Location:** Spaceport and Restaurants (Arunisiir/System).
**Ships:** N/A.

Nemo manages the sale of the crew's cargo. He obtains medicine and drugs for Fomega and arranges an elegant dinner. After negotiations, and with the help of Captain Bell (who takes a commission), Nemo manages to sell 19 tons of precious metals at an excellent price (140%), obtaining a total of **1,263,500 credits**.

### Scene: Espionage and Engineering on the Martin II
**PCs Present:** Paloma (Emilio), Tía (Juan), Fomega.

**Scene Summary:**
The PCs infiltrated into the crew of the *Martin II* take advantage of their shifts:
*   **Paloma (Emilio):** Hacks communications and discovers that an escort convoy will arrive in about 20 days. The convoy includes the *Comino*, the *Henry Ford*, and the *Sincerity*. She also briefly examines the mysterious "Black Cube" in the hangar, noting its unnatural material and imperial seal.
*   **Tía (Juan):** Works in engineering and socializes with the crew, earning the trust of Abra and Gensho. Through a hidden microphone (*bug*) later reviewed, Juan discovers that **Navigator Osha** secretly visits the "Black Cube" and examines it, which is highly suspicious.
*   **Fomega:** Tries to extract information from Marine Salvedes about his personal life to plan an ambush. However, Fomega asks too many direct questions and raises Salvedes' suspicions, who checks his identity and leaves alerted.

### Scene: Planning the Ambush
**PCs Present:** Nemo, Fermín (Nacho), Fomega, Emilio.
**NPCs Present:** N/A.
**Location:** City (Arunisiir/System).
**Ships:** N/A.

**Scene Summary:**
The group meets (physically or telematically) to plan how to neutralize Marine Salvedes and extract information. They dismiss an attack in the street and decide to rent a seedy motel room to set a trap for him. The plan involves using Salvedes' companion (with whom he meets) as bait or intercepting him there. They discuss methods to subdue him (electricity, drugs, numerical superiority), aware that Salvedes is a dangerous combatant.
