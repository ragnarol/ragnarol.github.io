# Session Title: Gods of Fantasy and the Ihatei Conspiracy

**PCs present:**
*   **Emilio** (Plays a scientist/explorer woman, possibly "Pika").
*   **Nacho** (Plays a technical/social character, possibly "Ondo").
*   **Nemo** (Captain).
*   **Paloma** (Mentioned, broker/hacker character, though the player is absent or inactive).

**NPCs present:**
*   **Tarja** (Native of Fantasy. Human of sculptural beauty but limited intellect. Archetype: The Innocent Savage).
*   **Utea** (Spaceport administrator of Keiteroa. Pragmatic and concerned with business. Archetype: The Neutral Merchant).
*   **Fiuq** (Aslan information merchant, a "Sinclan". Archetype: The Mercenary Informant).
*   **Teao** (Agent of the Aslan clans).
*   **Iqi "The Anxious"** (Ihatei leader, aggressive and heavily armored).
*   **Tohijo "The Brave"** (Young Ihatei leader).
*   **Heigh "The Wise"** (Elderly and tactical Aslan, uses a computer).

**Main developments in the campaign:**
*   It has been discovered that the planet **Fantasy** is inhabited by genetically modified humans (former slaves/breeders of the *Glorious Empire* Aslan) who lack advanced intelligence due to mental manipulation or blockage.
*   The group has devised a plan to divert the imminent invasion of the *Ihatei* (landless Aslan warriors) that threatens **Drinax**. The strategy involves manipulating information so that the Aslan attack and conquer **Fantasy** instead of Drinax, selling them the idea that Fantasy is a rich territory with slaves, while exaggerating Drinax's military defenses.

**Loose ends:**
*   The "mental block" (the cloud) of the natives of Fantasy requires advanced medical technology and facilities that the PCs currently lack to be cured.
*   Nacho must execute the bribery/manipulation plan with **Fiuq** to disseminate the false information without them discovering the deception.
*   The purchase of aerospace fighters for Drinax was left pending after a failed negotiation by Nemo.

## Scene 1: The Goddess of Fantasy
**PCs present:** Emilio.
**NPCs present:** Tarja (Native woman, perfect physique, speaks simplified *Trokh*).
**Location:** Mountains and jungle of Fantasy (Planet/System Fantasy).
**Ships mentioned:** Crashed Aslan ship (1000-ton ancient cargo/slave transport model).

**Summary:**
Emilio explores the surface of **Fantasy**, a world with gravity slightly higher than Earth's. He encounters humans of "sculptural" physical beauty but simple and primitive behavior who speak a degenerate dialect of *Trokh* (Aslan language). The natives, including a woman named **Tarja**, worship him as a "Goddess" due to his technology. Tarja guides Emilio to a "sacred place" which turns out to be an Aslan ship that crashed centuries ago and is covered in vegetation. Inside, Emilio discovers that the ship belonged to the *Glorious Empire* (a heretical Aslan faction that used slaves) and was transporting "breeders" (humans modified for breeding). Emilio deduces that the natives have an artificial mental block. He attempts to access the ship's computers, but the lack of power and tools prevents him from doing more, so he decides to return with the information.

## Scene 2: Espionage at the Spaceport
**PCs present:** Nacho.
**NPCs present:** Utea (Port administrator), Iqi "The Anxious", Tohijo "The Brave", Heigh "The Wise" (Aslan leaders).
**Location:** Spaceport and Control Tower in Keiteroa (Planet/System Keiteroa).
**Ships mentioned:** None specific, Ihatei ships are mentioned in general.

**Summary:**
Nacho remains in **Keiteroa** gathering information on the *Ihatei*'s movements. He observes that two main factions are forming, led by **Iqi** and **Tohijo** (advised by the elder **Heigh**), and that the departure of the invasion fleet is imminent. Nacho speaks with **Utea**, the port administrator, who confesses that she doesn't want the Aslan to leave because she would lose business. They agree that the ideal outcome would be to sabotage their plans or redirect them. Utea suggests that the best way to influence the Aslan leaders is through **Teao** (the clan agent) or **Fiuq** (the "Sinclan" information merchant). Nacho decides to prepare an expensive gift to try to gain an audience with Fiuq and manipulate him.

## Scene 3: The New Strategic Plan
**PCs present:** Emilio, Nacho, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** PCs' ship (Keiteroa).
**Ships mentioned:** Harrier (reference to the Drinax ship).

**Summary:**
The group reunites after Emilio's return. Emilio shares his discovery about **Fantasy**: it is a habitable planet, with a docile population (perfect slaves for the *Glorious Empire*'s mentality), and no defenses. They cross-reference this information with the situation in **Keiteroa**. They decide that the best way to save **Drinax** is not to fight, but to convince the Aslan that Drinax is a difficult target (inventing false military defenses) and that **Fantasy** is the big prize: a lost world of the *Glorious Empire* ready to be reconquered. They plan to use **Fiuq** to leak this fabricated "intelligence." Nemo admits that his previous attempt to buy fighters for Drinax failed because he is not a good negotiator, reinforcing the need for this deception plan.
