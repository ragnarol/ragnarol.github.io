### Ship Delivery and Recognition
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Pika, Juan's Character, Álvaro's Character.
**NPCs present:** Lord Wrax (Admiral of the Star Guard, serious, reluctant to hand over the ship), King Oleb XVI (mentioned as the drunk patron).
**Location:** Star Guard Hangar (Drinax).
**Ships:** Banshee (Harrier Class, Tech Level 15), System defense ships (mentioned).

**Scene Summary:**
The Game Master describes the current situation. After accepting King Oleb XVI's offer, the characters are escorted by the Star Guard to their new ship. It is a ship of Sindalite design, technologically very advanced (TL 15), superior to what Drinax can currently produce. They meet Lord Wrax, who is unhappy to hand over such a valuable asset to some "mercenaries/privateers," but he obeys orders. It is explained that Drinax's fleet is scarce, mainly composed of defense ships without jump drives. The King has ordered them to get the ship operational and take it to port for inspection. The group begins to organize, choosing cabins; Nemo claims one of the best, while others settle for what's available.

### Officers' Meeting: Hierarchy and Wine
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Pika, Juan's Character, Álvaro's Character.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** Command Bridge / Officers' Lounge (The Banshee).
**Ships:** Banshee.

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo calls a meeting on the bridge, assuming the role of Captain and toasting with a bottle of wine (possibly found on the ship). The immediate plan of action is discussed. Nemo suggests raiding a small merchant ship to test the systems and coordinate. Paloma proposes searching for trade routes. Pika suggests contacting Sal Danczo, the smuggler who brought them, as she might have information about vulnerable enemies or rivals, which would be a good starting point for making "friends" at home. They agree to dock at Drinax, make purchases, and then depart.

### The Division of Booty and Logistics
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Pika, Juan's Character.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** The Banshee (Drinax).
**Ships:** Banshee.

**Scene Summary:**
An intense discussion takes place regarding the ship's finances. It is agreed that 10% of the loot goes to King Oleb. Of the remainder, Nemo proposes setting aside 50% for the ship's fund (repairs and maintenance). The dispute arises over the distribution of the remainder: the pirate norm is usually 5 parts for the captain, 2 for officers, and 1 for the crew. Juan's character opposes the captain earning so much ("Socialism" vs. military ranks). After a debate, Nemo agrees to lower his share to 4 to calm things down. The cost of maintaining each character's living standard (Social Standing) is also discussed. Pika expresses her desire to buy protocol and cleaning robots, but the catalog prices (from 350,000 to millions of credits) are prohibitive for now.

### Christening and Final Planning
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Pika, Juan's Character.
**NPCs present:** Sal Danczo (mentioned as a contact).
**Location:** The Banshee (Drinax).
**Ships:** Banshee.

**Scene Summary:**
Finally, the ship's name is confirmed: **Banshee**, in the absence of a better proposal. Paloma's idea of going to search for Sindalite ruins immediately is discarded, as the GM clarifies that it would require a lot of time and specialized archaeological knowledge, and is not as simple as finding treasure in plain sight. The group decides that their immediate priority is to obtain information (investigate targets) and undertake small jobs to earn money and better equip the ship before facing the Empire or larger objectives. The plan is to go see Sal Danczo at the palace.
