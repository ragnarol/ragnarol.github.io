### The Wait and the Ambush

**PJs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None relevant in active scene.
**Location(s):** Gas Giant / Deep Space (Exe System).
**Ship(s):** *Banshee* (PJ Ship), *Subsidized Merchant* (Merchant Freighter, Target).

**Summary:**
After refueling and refining fuel, the crew decides to wait in the shadow of the system's gas giant in Exe with passive sensors activated. They detect the arrival of a merchant freighter (*Subsidized Merchant*) heading for Highport. The crew decides to intercept it while maintaining stealth and approaching at assault speed. They perform a detailed scan revealing a defensive turret, about 15 people on board (some in cryogenic sleep), and a full cargo hold, detecting high-density and radioactive materials.

### Intimidation and Warning Shot

**PJs present:** All (in their combat stations).
**NPCs present:** Merchant Captain (Voice over radio, scared and pragmatic).
**Location(s):** Space near the planet (Exe System).
**Ship(s):** *Banshee* (PJ Ship), *Subsidized Merchant* (Target).

**Summary:**
The crew blocks the merchant's communications (jamming) to prevent them from calling for help. Nemo opens a channel and impersonates a PRQ (*Pax Ruling Quartermasters*) authority, demanding they stop and threatening to destroy them with their particle cannon. The merchant captain tries to negotiate by offering to release some cargo, but the PJ crew demands a full boarding. To demonstrate they are serious, Rocío fires at the merchant's defensive turret, disabling it and damaging the hull. The merchant surrenders, shuts down engines, and prepares to be boarded, but warns that a patrol will arrive shortly.

### The Loot Against the Clock

**PJs present:** James Hondo, Wolf, Nemo (Boarding team); Honor, Rocío, Tia (Ship support).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Assisting with cargo), Merchant Crew (Surrendered/Intimidated).
**Location(s):** Merchant Cargo Hold and Connecting Hatches.
**Ship(s):** *Banshee* and *Subsidized Merchant*.

**Summary:**
With a time limit of approximately one hour before reinforcements arrive, the boarding team enters the ship. While Wolf and Hondo secure the area and intimidate the crew into cooperating, Nemo and the others begin to transfer the cargo. They use the ship's machinery (forklifts) and human chains to move tons of merchandise.
During the process, Nemo has an accident and a box falls on him, injuring him. They manage to identify and specifically steal tons of radioactive material, precious metals, gems, and rare minerals, filling their own hold almost to capacity (approx. 24 tons).

### Escape and Jump to Acrid

**PJs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Ann (Calculating jump).
**Location(s):** Deep Space (Exe System) and Jump Space.
**Ship(s):** *Patrol Corvette* (Enemy Patrol Corvette).

**Summary:**
Just as they finish loading, sensors detect a Patrol Corvette approaching at high speed. The crew disconnects hastily and Rocío accelerates the ship to get away. While Honor and Tia manage the evasion, Emilio (Tia/Ann) calculates the data for the interstellar jump under pressure. The enemy corvette sweeps them with sensors multiple times but fails to intercept them before they activate the jump drive.
During the week in hyperspace, the crew inventories the stolen "surprise boxes," confirming a millionaire's haul.

### Welcome to Acrid

**PJs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Customs Control (Voice over radio, Authority).
**Location(s):** Orbit / Approach to the planet (Acrid System).
**Ship(s):** *Banshee*.

**Summary:**
The ship emerges from the jump in the Acrid system. They decide not to refuel at the gas giant and head directly for the main planet (Technology Level 6, Lawless). However, upon approaching, they receive communication from the local authority, identifying themselves as *Pax Ruling Quartermasters* (PRQ) – the same faction they have robbed and impersonated. They welcome them and order them to prepare for a customs inspection. The session ends with the tension of having the hold full of stolen merchandise with the PRQ logo as the inspectors approach.
