### Meeting at the Highport
**PCs present:** Lyra, Clayton, Pika, Jimmy, Félix.
**NPCs present:** None relevant (local waiters/porters).
**Location:** Bar in Marduk Highport (Marduk/Marduk System).
**Ships:** The Ginger (Mentioned, docked at the port, equipped with twin laser turrets).

The group arrives at Marduk Spaceport (Marduk High). Lyra has received instructions from the Royal House of Drinax to meet Jimmy Mendoza. Jimmy informs them that they must go down to the planet (Marduk Downport) to pick up a package held by one Johnny Belen and take it to Drinax. During the meal, they introduce themselves: Lyra and her crew (Clayton and Pika) meet, while Félix introduces himself as an ex-diplomat and accountant interested in attracting King Oleb's attention. Pika enjoys some local noodles. It is established that the atmosphere at the port is tense due to incursions by Oghma barbarians.

### The Interrupted Descent
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:**
*   **Finan Tremix** (Heavy investor trying to involve Pika and Félix in a fishing business scheme).
*   **Evan** (*Vargr* lawyer, nervous, working on his tablet).
*   **Karim** (Native, pragmatic, seems to know the port personnel).
**Location:** Interior of a transport Shuttle (Orbit-surface transit).
**Ships:** Passenger shuttle (Standard orbital transport model).

The group boards the shuttle to the surface along with three other passengers. During the journey, Finan tries to sell an investment opportunity to Pika and Félix, claiming to have insider information from GeDeCo. The conversation is cut short when the captain announces a massive attack by Oghma ships on the spaceport. The shuttle performs evasive maneuvers and dodges two missiles, but a third explodes close enough to damage the ship, killing the pilots and causing the vessel to nosedive towards the surface between the jungle and islands of Marduk.

### Survival and Escape
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Evan (Archetype: Coward/Useless Civilian), Finan (Archetype: Nuisance/Materialist), Karim (Archetype: Guide/Survivor).
**Location:** Crash site on Marduk surface (Steppe/Jungle zone under torrential rain).
**Ships:**
*   Crashed shuttle (Total loss).
*   *Subsidized Merchant* (400t freighter, likely captured by pirates, lands nearby after the crash).

After the crash, the PCs wake up bruised but alive. The ship is destroyed and the pilots are dead. Under the leadership of Lyra and Jimmy, and with medical assistance from Félix, the group quickly scavenges emergency equipment: a survival kit for 12 people, a shotgun, a rifle, food, water, and warm clothing. Karim warns that the Oghma barbarians will come to capture slaves. Indeed, a merchant ship (presumably hostile) lands nearby. The group decides to abandon the shuttle wreckage immediately. They head towards a rugged area to make tracking by vehicles difficult, with Félix in the rear trying to erase their tracks under a freezing rain that is beginning to cause hypothermia. Finan and Evan are terrified and barely cooperate, while Karim guides the group.
