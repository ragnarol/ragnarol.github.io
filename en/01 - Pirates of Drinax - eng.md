# The Letter of Marque and the Legacy of Sindal

**PCs present**
*   **Fomega** (Scout/Mechanic/Medic): A tall and strong man, wears a wool hat and has a goatee. Seems to have memory problems.
*   **Jane** (Rocío): Ex-military. Tall and strong, redhead (dyed), wears cargo pants and a rifle on her back.
*   **Nemo** (James Nando): Noble/Ex-marine. A tall man, with long hair in a ponytail and a blue-dyed beard. Uses makeup and elegant suits to hide his age.
*   **Emilio:** Noble/Astronavigator. A good-looking man, with a firm posture that denotes nobility and military training.
*   **Pika** (Paloma): Pilot. A small woman of Asian features, tanned skin and a shaved head with black painted eyes. She is antisocial and only eats processed food.
*   **Jimmy Mendoza:** Soldier. A man of athletic build, wiry, tanned skin, and a large American-style mustache.

**NPCs present**
*   **Saldancet** (Independent Merchant): The captain who transported the PCs to Drinax.
*   **Bri Tolar** (Hawk Guard): Sergeant of the guard, wears a Battle Dress armor. Has minor noble titles (Viscountess, etc.).
*   **King Oleb XVI** (King of Drinax): A huge, bombastic man who is fond of wine. A dreamer with airs of grandeur, he seeks to restore the empire.
*   **Princess Rao** (Heir of Drinax): Young, intelligent, and pragmatic. She is the brains behind the clandestine operation.
*   **Lord Drax** (Admiral of the Star Guard): Loyal to the king, in charge of the system's defense and custodian of the ship.

**Important Developments in the PJs' Lives or the Campaign**
*   The characters have accepted a **Letter of Marque** from King Oleb XVI, officially becoming privateers (pirates) in the secret service of Drinax.
*   The long-term goal is to destabilize trade in the *Trojan Reach* to force independent systems to seek Drinax's protection, thus rebuilding the ancient Sindal Empire.
*   The group has taken possession of a **Harrier-class Trade Incursor**, a high-tech but very old ship, which will serve as their base of operations.

**Loose Ends**
*   The ship requires continuous repairs; although functional, the hull is damaged (56/88 points) and systems consume double energy until fully tuned.
*   Nemo has a personal vendetta against his nephew, whom he wants dead to secure his noble title.
*   The ship's name has not been fully formalized, though "Banshee" is the favorite.
*   The crew must keep their affiliation with Drinax absolutely secret, or the Imperium or the Aslan will retaliate.

### Scene 1: Arrival at the Floating Palace

**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Saldancet (Merchant), Bri Tolar (Hawk Guard, Sergeant in power armor).
**Location:** Cargo Docks (Floating Palace / Drinax).
**Ships:** Saldancet's Ship (Merchant Freighter, Captain Saldancet).

The group arrives at the planet Drinax, a world devastated by the Aslan two centuries ago. They land at the Floating Palace, a magnificent baroque structure that hovers above the radioactive surface thanks to antigravity technology. Captain Saldancet drops them off at the docks, where they are met by Sergeant Bri Tolar of the Hawk Guard. Their weapons and armor are confiscated for security before the royal audience. While being escorted through service tunnels (to maintain their presence secret), the characters observe the contrast between the palace's priceless works of art and the functional poverty of its inhabitants, who use ancient relics for mundane tasks.

### Scene 2: The Dragon King's Offer

**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** King Oleb XVI (King of Drinax, bombastic, drinker, archetype of "The Bombastic King"), Princess Rao (Heiress, young, shrewd, archetype of "The Mastermind").
**Location:** Throne Room (Floating Palace / Drinax).

The characters are brought before King Oleb in the Throne Room, presided over by the Dragon Throne, made from the wreckage of defeated starships. Oleb, with a goblet of wine in hand and great enthusiasm, reveals his master plan: to restore the glory of the Kingdom of Drinax. He offers them a "gem" from the ancient Sindal Empire: a *Harrier* warship. In exchange, he delivers a digitally signed Letter of Marque. Their orders are to attack stellar trade (both Imperial and Aslan) to "bleed them dry" until neighboring worlds beg for Drinax's protection.

The conditions are clear:
1.  10% of the loot goes to the King.
2.  They must maintain Drinax's involvement in absolute secrecy.
3.  They must win hearts and minds in border worlds, not just steal.
4.  If successful, they will receive noble titles and lands.

Princess Rao appears to add a dose of reality and pragmatism to her father's plan, suggesting that political marriage with one of the PCs could be a future reward.

### Scene 3: Inspection and Repair of the Harrier

**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Lord Drax (Admiral, loyal, archetype of "The Old Military").
**Location:** Drinax Orbit (Gas Giant Moon / Drinax System).
**Ships:** Harrier (Sindalian Trade Incursor, No Captain assigned yet).

Lord Drax escorts the characters to a distant moon where the ship is hidden. The *Harrier* is a Tech Level 15 ship, with advanced capabilities like stealth jumps and particle weaponry, but it is in a state of evident deterioration after centuries of abandonment or misuse. The interior is luxurious, paneled in wood and decorated with bas-reliefs, but functionally touched.

The characters (and players) spend time assessing the damage and spending their resources ("Ship Shares") to get it ready:
*   Repair the missile turret to have a 360-degree firing arc.
*   Stabilize the maneuver drive to prevent critical shutdowns.
*   Improve general systems to reduce maintenance costs.
*   Partially repair the hull (reaching 56 out of 88 health points).
*   Invest in cosmetics to make the hull look intimidating (possibly painting a skull or symbol).

### Scene 4: Assignment of Roles and Quarters

**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** Ship Deck (Harrier / Drinax System).
**Ships:** Harrier (Sindalian Trade Incursor, Captain Nemo).

After the repairs, the group discusses the ship's hierarchy and distribution.
*   **Captain:** It is agreed that **Nemo** will be captain due to his social status and experience.
*   **Officers:** It is established that key roles (Pilot, Engineer, Gunner, Astrogator/Communications) will have officer rank.
*   **Second in Command:** Pika (Paloma) is designated as second in command/Commodore, despite her antisocial nature, to manage the ship while the captain sleeps.
*   **Accommodation:** The four luxury officer cabins are assigned to the nobles and principal officers (Nemo, Emilio, Jane/Rocío). Pika, despite being an officer, prefers to sleep in a standard, dark, and isolated cabin, ceding her luxury spot to Fomega or Juan.

The ship's name is debated, with **"Banshee"** being the strongest option, though it is not definitively closed. The session ends with the crew ready to seek their first loot and supplies, as they have no liquid cash or credits.
