# Session Title: Diplomatic Dilemmas and the Iron Tooth Plot

**PCs present**

*   Juan Maldonado (Security / Marine)
*   Fomega (Engineer / Mechanic)
*   Paloma (Hacker / Computer Specialist)
*   Fermín (Investigator)
*   Emilio (Pilot / Astrogator)

**NPCs present**
*   **Ecaf** (Aslan Leader. Physique: 2.20m - 2.30m tall, muscular, bristling fur. Archetype: The Honorable/Savage Warrior).
*   **Captain Torza** (Imperial Ship Captain. Physique: Ceremonial uniform. Archetype: The Protocol Officer).
*   **Commander Mari Llagad** (Imperial Officer. Physique: Piercing gaze. Archetype: The Perceptive Suspect).
*   **Halmi Barbalep** (Second Officer. Archetype: The Logistician).
*   **Smith** (Imperial Pilot. Physique: Older, near retirement. Archetype: The Talkative Veteran).
*   **Oshan** (Astrogator. Physique: Blue skin, gills, pointed ears, aquatic. Archetype: The Exotic Navigator).

*   **Salvesdes** (Pilot's husband. Physique: Strange/disturbing behavior. Archetype: The Coerced Accomplice).
*   **Aunt Clare** (Ally/Crewmate, covers for Paloma at work).

**Important Developments in PCs' or Campaign Lives**
*   Nemo establishes a commercial and "hunting" alliance with the Aslan leader, Ecaf, promising tributes and seeking a safe haven for future operations.
*   The group discovers it is nearly impossible to open the imperial ship's treasure chamber by conventional means (requires being in the Tioc system, a physical key, a biogenetic scanner, and specific navigation data).
*   A parallel plot is revealed: the pirate **Roll Iron Tooth** is blackmailing the shuttle pilot (threatening her daughter) to sabotage the ship's jump and divert it to the **Exe** system, where his pirate fleet awaits.

**Loose Ends**
*   The whereabouts and activities of the marine that Fermín and Juan tried to follow but lost in the city.
*   The final decision on how to execute the heist: Take the ship from the inside by eliminating the astrogators, try to hack the jump (very difficult), or let the Iron Tooth pirates attack?
*   The exact nature of Captain Torza's "physical key."

### Scene 1: The Tribute to the Aslans
**PCs present:** Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Ecaf (Aslan Leader, imposing and direct), Aslans from the camp.
**Location:** Aslan camp near Spaceport (Planet with atmosphere).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo visits the Aslan camp to deliver the promised jewels as tribute. He meets **Ecaf**, who, surrounded by his armed entourage and working females, receives the partial payment with some skepticism but accepts the alliance. Ecaf questions Nemo's true intentions, to which Nemo admits he is seeking a strong ally and a safe place to hide from future enemies ("competitors"). Ecaf values sincerity and strength, agreeing to a friendship based on mutual benefit.

### Scene 2: Infiltration of the Treasure Ship
**PCs present:** Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Captain Torza (Imperial, strict), Commander Mari Llagad (Imperial, suspicious, friend of Rocío), Halmi Barbalep, Smith, Oshan.
**Location:** Interior of the Imperial Treasure Ship (Spaceport).
**Ships:** Imperial Treasure Ship (Model unknown, Captain Torza).

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo, accompanied by the Aslans (carrying the jewels), manages to enter the imperial ship under the pretense of depositing the tribute in the armored chamber. Captain **Torza** gives them a tour, showing them the bridge and politely (but firmly) refusing to open the chamber, stating it only opens at the final destination (**Tioc**) and that the cargo will be safe in the hold. During the visit, Nemo observes the security systems and notices Commander **Mari Llagad** watching him with extreme suspicion. Nemo memorizes the bridge layout and identifies the key officers (Smith and the alien Oshan).

### Scene 3: Failed Surveillance in the City
**PCs present:** Juan Maldonado, Fermín (mentioned as Nacho/Jimmy).
**NPCs present:** An imperial marine (Surveillance target).
**Location:** Spaceport and City (Planet with atmosphere).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Juan and Fermín attempt to follow an imperial crew marine who goes on leave. Juan disguises himself and changes his appearance, while Fermín searches for clues in the garbage. They wait at the spaceport, but when the marine leaves, she takes the only available taxi to the city and they lose sight of her. They spend the rest of the day trying to locate her at transport stations and tourist offices without success.

### Scene 4: Social Engineering and Dark Secrets
**PCs present:** Fomega, Emilio, Paloma.
**NPCs present:** Smith (Pilot), Shuttle Pilot (Blackmailed), Salvesdes (Suspicious husband).
**Location:** Cantina / Mess Hall of the Imperial Ship (Spaceport).
**Ships:** Imperial Treasure Ship.

**Scene Summary:**
Fomega and Emilio infiltrate the crew socially. Emilio speaks with **Smith**, who reveals that the treasure chamber contains vital imperial documents for the Aslan clans and that its opening requires very specific conditions (Tioc coordinates, background radiation, etc.) that cannot be easily replicated. Fomega speaks with the shuttle pilot, who, under pressure, confesses to being blackmailed by the pirate **Roll Iron Tooth**. The pirates' plan is to sabotage the jump drive to divert the ship to the **Exe** system. The previous mechanic, **Fellmar**, died trying to manipulate the coordinates. Now, she and her husband **Salvesdes** must find a way to do it or their daughter will die.

### Scene 5: The Assault Dilemma
**PCs present:** All (Nemo, Fomega, Paloma, Juan, Emilio, Fermín).
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** PCs' meeting place (Likely their ship or a secure location).
**Ships:** Banshee (Harrier, PCs).

**Scene Summary:**
The group gathers to consolidate information. Paloma confirms after a successful hack (with Aunt Clare's help) that they cannot open the chamber without the Captain's physical key, a genetic sample from an officer, and a Level 15 Technological Computer to simulate Tioc navigation data. Given the impossibility of opening the chamber on the planet and the discovery of the Iron Tooth pirates' plot, the PCs debate their options: ally with the Empire (ruled out due to little benefit), let the pirates attack and steal from them afterward, or take control of the ship themselves. The most viable option appears to be kidnapping or eliminating the navigators (Smith and Oshan) and taking control of the jump to take the ship to a place where they can dismantle it calmly, escorted by the *Banshee*.
