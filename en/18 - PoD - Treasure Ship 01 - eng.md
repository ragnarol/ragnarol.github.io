# Infiltration of the Martin II

**PCs present:** Nemo (Captain), Emilio (Pika), Rocío, Paloma, Juan, Nacho (Fermín), Alphomega.
**NPCs present:** Krrsh, Abra, Mechanic Polo, Commander Mari Jagat, Yan, O'Leary, Ilyn, Bell.

**Important Developments:**
*   A critical flaw is discovered in the PCs' ship's sensors, caused by a mummified corpse hidden in the conduits, which will require costly repairs.
*   Part of the crew successfully infiltrates the treasure ship, the *Martin II*, by being hired as engineers and mechanics, taking a giant step towards the goal of looting it.

**Loose Ends:**
*   The identity and origin of the corpse in a Drinax uniform found in the PCs' ship's sensors remains a mystery.
*   The complete repair of the sensors costs almost 3 million credits, money they do not currently have.
*   The plan to open the *Martin II*'s vault remains undefined, as jump coordinates and specific codes are required.

### Jump Failure and the Corpse in the Sensors
**PCs present:** Nemo, Emilio, Rocío, Paloma, Juan, Nacho, Alphomega.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** Deep space / Distant orbit (Arunisir System).
**Ships:** Harrier (Fighters, Captain Nemo), Gacela (Imperial Escort, in orbit).

The crew discusses the strategy for jumping to the Arunisir system, deciding to use their ship's stealth to avoid detection by the orbiting *Gacela* escort. Upon arrival, they attempt a passive sensor sweep, but the system fails catastrophically.
After emergency repairs led by Emilio, Rocío, and Álvarito, they discover the cause: a mummified corpse in an old Drinax navy uniform (from about 300 years ago) was stuck between the wires. The damage is severe and the repair will cost a fortune. Despite the failure, they manage to detect that the *Martin II* is on the surface and decide to land in a wild and remote area.

### Landing and Approach to Civilization
**PCs present:** Nemo, Emilio, Rocío, Paloma, Juan, Nacho, Alphomega.
**NPCs present:** Truck Driver (Human, obese, transport driver; archetype of the hardworking and distrustful local).
**Location:** Wild area / Rural road (Planet Arunisir).
**Ships:** Harrier.

The crew lands the ship in a wooded valley and camouflages it with holograms. They decide to walk to a nearby urban center to get transport. Along the way, they are picked up by a worker's truck.
Through the driver, they learn about Arunisir's political situation: the planet is divided into 12 Aslan clans, but the Aslans are mere puppets dedicated to hunting and posing, while human counselors are the ones who actually govern. They also hear rumors about "The People's League," a local terrorist group frowned upon by the population. The driver drops them off in a nearby city.

### Reconnaissance at the Spaceport and the Bar
**PCs present:** All (divided into groups).
**NPCs present:**
*   **Yan** (Imperial Scout, Scout pilot; archetype of the momentary local hero).
*   **O'Leary** (Crew member of the Martin II, gunner; archetype of the garrulous and lazy employee).
*   **Bell** (Captain of the *Hopeful Wanderer*; archetype of the independent merchant).
**Location:** Local city and *Arunisir Bar* at the Spaceport (Planet Arunisir).
**Ships:** Land Rovers (Purchased ground vehicles), Martin II (Damaged heavy freighter), Hopeful Wanderer (Far Trader), Fafnir (Far Trader).

The group buys two Land Rovers and heads to the spaceport, which appears to be a settlement built around the hull of an old Aslan ship. They split up to gather information in the cantina.
Emilio talks to Yan, a Scout pilot who is celebrated as a hero for having reported the *Martin II*'s accident. Nemo and Nacho play cards with O'Leary, a crew member of the *Martin II*, who reveals that the ship suffered a jump drive accident and that the engineering section was vented into space, killing all the technical personnel. They learn that the ship is desperate for engineers for repairs.

### The Job Interview and the Old Rival
**PCs present:** Rocío, Paloma, Emilio, Alphomega.
**NPCs present:**
*   **Mechanic Polo** (Acting Chief Mechanic; archetype of the stressed and geeky technician).
*   **Commander Mari Jagat** (Executive Officer of the Martin II, human, attractive and severe; archetype of the military "Femme Fatale" and former rival).
*   **Imperial Marines** (Guards in Battle Dress; archetype of unmovable force).
**Location:** Interior of the Martin II (Arunisir Spaceport).
**Ships:** Martin II.

Rocío, Paloma, Emilio, and Alphomega present themselves as local mechanics or mercenaries looking for work. They are escorted inside the *Martin II* past guards in combat armor (*Battle Dress*).
Mechanic Polo gives them a quick technical interview. When it seems they are being accepted, Commander Mari Jagat appears. Surprisingly, Jagat recognizes Rocío from their days at military academy; they were rivals, and Rocío "stole" her boyfriend in the past. Far from rejecting her, Jagat, in a position of power and desperate for qualified personnel after the accident, decides to hire Rocío and her team with an attitude of superiority, assigning them bunks on the ship. The team is inside.
