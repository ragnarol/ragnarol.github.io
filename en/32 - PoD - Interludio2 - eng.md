# Session Title: Palatial Intrigues and the Iatei Threat

**PCs present:**
*   Hondo (Captain)
*   Honor (Pilot/Broker)
*   Pika (Sensors/Scientist)
*   Goran Dragic (Soldier/Engineer)
*   Fomega (Medic/Engineer)
*   Fermín (Soldier)
*   Nemo (Hacker/Computers)

**NPCs present:**
*   **Princess Rao** (Heir to the throne of Drinax, pragmatic, demanding, and strategic).
*   **Jefa Drax** (Leader of the Vespexers, distrustful of "renegades", tough trader).
*   **Cera** (Allied merchant, wife of an Aslan noble).
*   **Cera's Aslan Husband** (Hologram, noble concerned about his missing son).
*   **Arpa** (Harrier crew, attentive to sensors).
*   **Chris** (Harrier crew, cynical and direct).
*   **Rocío** (Harrier crew, gunner).
*   **Nax** (Ship's Artificial Intelligence).

**Important developments in the PCs' lives or the campaign:**
*   **Hierarchy Restructuring:** Captain Hondo abolishes official military ranks on the ship to adopt a more egalitarian pirate/privateer structure (Captain and First Mate), seeking to improve morale and cohesion.
*   **New Mission:** Princess Rao tasks the group with stopping the formation of an *Iatei* invasion fleet (landless Aslan second sons) gathering on planet Kteiroa with the intention of attacking Drinax.
*   **Ship Upgrades:** A medical bay is installed on the *Banshee*, sacrificing cabin space, and general repairs are carried out.

**Loose ends:**
*   **The Fake Treaty:** It is confirmed that the treaty found on the treasure ship (which proposed reducing the non-aggression zone between the Empire and the Hieratic) is a forgery or a conspiracy by an imperial faction, which could trigger a war.
*   **The Missing Son:** Cera's Aslan husband requests information about his second son, whose ship was shot down in the T-Bus (or Thebus) system.
*   **The Ceremonial Axe (*Yuhai*):** An Aslan axe is recovered from the wreckage of the scout ship, which could identify the specific clan behind the threat, but it has not yet been thoroughly analyzed.

## Scene 1: Logistics and Reforms
**PCs present:** Hondo, Fomega, Goran, Pika, Honor, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** N/A
**Location:** Hangar / Ship Interior (Planet Drinax)
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Harrier Model, Captain Hondo)

**Summary:**
The group intensely debates modifications to the *Banshee*. Fomega insists on the installation of a complete infirmary, arguing that as pirates, there will be wounded. Despite concerns about weight and lost cabin space (an officer's cabin is removed to make room), Captain Hondo approves the installation. Hondo takes the opportunity to announce a change in crew philosophy: they will cease using navy ranks to operate under a pirate code, with only a Captain and a First Mate (Honor), equalizing the rest of the crew. Remaining cabins are assigned.

## Scene 2: Encounters in the Bazaar and Hospital
**PCs present:** Honor, Fomega, Hondo, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Jefa Drax (Vespexer Leader), Cera (Merchant), Cera's Aslan Husband (Hologram).
**Location:** The Bazaar and Hospital of the Floating Palace (Planet Drinax).
**Ships:** N/A

**Summary:**
During the repair period (approx. 2 months), the characters conduct personal errands.
*   **Honor** attempts to curry favor with **Jefa Drax** by assisting her in a negotiation for environmental suits. Although she secures a better price, Drax remains suspicious of a "renegade's" influence but gifts her a suit as payment.
*   **Fomega** seeks combat drugs, planning a trip to Tech-World to acquire them, and parades with her hero medal.
*   **Hondo** acquires advanced software and a holographic projector. He unsuccessfully searches for extra crew members.
*   **Nemo**, while recovering from an implant surgery (*wafer jack*), receives a call from **Cera's** Aslan husband. He informs Nemo that his second son has disappeared in T-Bus and requests that they find his whereabouts.

## Scene 3: The Audience with the Princess
**PCs present:** All (Hondo, Pika, Goran, Fomega, Fermín, Honor, Nemo).
**NPCs present:** Princess Rao (Severe Aristocrat), Falcon Guards.
**Location:** A room under construction in the Floating Palace (Planet Drinax).
**Ships:** N/A

**Summary:**
**Princess Rao** summons the crew. She coolly assesses their performance over the past six months; while praising the theft of the treasure ship and the acquisition of the fake treaty, she criticates their inefficiency and greed for spending too much time repairing and "blinging out" instead of being in space gaining influence. Rao reveals an imminent threat: hundreds of Aslan ships are gathering on **Kteiroa**. They are *Iatei* (landless second sons) preparing for an invasion, and Drinax is a likely target. She orders them to stop this fleet. They also briefly discuss **Prince Harrik** and his status on Clarke.

## Scene 4: Emergency Interception
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Arpa (Observer), Nax (AI).
**Location:** Floating Palace and Low Orbit (Planet Drinax).
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Harrier Model), Aslan Scout Ship (Scout 100ton, Jump-4).

**Summary:**
The meeting is interrupted when **Arpa** detects a hidden ship on the surface of Drinax that has just taken off, presumably a spy that has been monitoring the Palace. The crew rushes to the *Banshee*, which is still undergoing partial repairs. With the help of the AI **Nax**, they manage to quickly power up the engines and pursue through Drinax's stormy atmosphere. They identify the enemy ship as a small Aslan Scout with Jump-4 capability.

## Scene 5: Combat and Impact Zone
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Rocío (Gunner), Chris (Crew).
**Location:** Orbit and Surface of Drinax.
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Harrier Model), Aslan Scout Ship (Destroyed).

**Summary:**
A chase ensues. The Aslan ship attempts to flee and evade, but the *Banshee* is faster. Hondo orders shots fired at the jump engines to prevent its escape. After an exchange of fire, a critical hit from the *Banshee's* particles causes the enemy ship to lose control and crash violently onto the surface of Drinax.
The crew lands to investigate the wreckage. They find the charred bodies of two Aslan and recover a ceremonial axe (*Yuhai*). The scene ends with tension between **Fomega** and **Goran** ("the new guy"), with Chris intervening to prevent a physical altercation between crewmates.
