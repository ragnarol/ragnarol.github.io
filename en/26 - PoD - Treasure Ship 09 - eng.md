**Location(s):** Spaceport / Surroundings of the docked ship (Unknown Planet), City.
**Ships mentioned:** Hopeful Wanderer (Trader, Captain Val).

**Scene summary:**
The group splits up. While Fermín and Nacho look for a suitable ambush location in the city, Nemo watches the exterior of the *Martin II* with binoculars, waiting to see marine Salvedes emerge. Paloma begins hacking the ship's systems. Nemo receives a farewell message from Captain Val, who is leaving the system. Fermín finds a suitable spot for the ambush, while Juan gets drunk and gets a siren/Ophi tattoo in the city.

### Scene 2: The Diplomatic (and Physical) Incident
**PCs present:** Aunt, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Marijagad (Antagonist Officer, "the scab"), Security Marines.
**Location(s):** Cargo Deck / Brig (Ship *Martin II*).

**Scene summary:**
Aunt tries to smooth things over with officer Marijagad by mentioning their shared past and the boyfriend she "took" from her. The conversation goes terribly wrong and they end up in a fist and scratch fight. Marines intervene, and Aunt is dragged to the brig. Fomega uses the chaos to try to get a blood sample (DNA) from Marijagad to clone her biometric access, but fails, obtaining a contaminated and mixed sample.

### Scene 3: Road to Hell and Drugs
**PCs present:** Nemo, Juan, Fermín, Fomega (mentioned).
**NPCs present:** Wolf (Henchman), Nacho (Terrible Driver).
**Location(s):** Night road to the base / The Ship *Banshee*.
**Ships mentioned:** Banshee (PC ship).

**Scene summary:**
Fermín, Juan, Wolf, and Nemo return to their base ship (*Banshee*) hidden in the woods. The journey is a disaster due to bad driving and darkness, losing a lot of time. Upon arrival, or while discussing the situation, Nemo confronts Fomega (who is working double shifts on the infiltrated ship) for stealing and abusing "Alvarito's" combat drugs and stimulants. Nemo confiscates the drugs and threatens him, although Fomega insists he needs them to work.

### Scene 4: Advocacy and Productive Hacking
**PCs present:** Emilio, Paloma, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Captain of the Martin II (Elderly, distant, seemingly incompetent or disinterested), Logistics Officer (*Purser*).
**Location(s):** Command Bridge / Engineering Deck (Ship *Martin II*).

**Scene summary:**
Emilio requests an audience with the Captain to intercede for Aunt. Using his legal knowledge, he argues that it was a personal dispute and that Aunt is needed for repairs. The Captain agrees not to imprison her but dismisses her and expels her from the ship. Meanwhile, Paloma succeeds in hacking the logistics officer's computer, obtaining the full cargo manifest from the vault and finding suspicious encrypted communications. Fomega examines the jump drive and determines that repair is beyond his capabilities.

### Scene 5: The Ultimatum
**PCs present:** All (group discussion).
**NPCs present:** Marine Salvedes (Target).
**Location(s):** Operations Base / Ship *Martin II*.

**Scene summary:**
The group debates frustratedly about the constant change of plans. Finally, they agree that the priority is to eliminate marine Salvedes before attempting to take the ship, as his combat armor (*Battle Dress*) is an insurmountable threat. They decide to send him an anonymous message to his personal terminal blackmailing him: "We know what you're doing. Bring 20,000 credits to [Ambush Location] or we'll tell the captain." The goal is to lure him off the ship to ambush him at the site Fermín located.
