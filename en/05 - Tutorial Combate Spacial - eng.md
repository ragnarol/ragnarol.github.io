# Scaling in Borite and Combat Maneuvers

**PCs present**
*   Captain Nemo (Leader and "face" of the group)
*   Paloma (Pilot)
*   Rocío (Gunner/Marine)
*   Emilio (Communications and Sensors)
*   Alvarito/Fomega (Engineer and Sensors)
*   Juan/Jimmy Balder (Marine and support)

**NPCs present**
*   Blaine (Simulation instructor, likely an AI or unelaborated crew member)
*   Krusch (Mentioned - Pirate Captain of the *Miseries Company*)
*   Holmer (Mentioned - Merchant and contact)
*   Daniel Blau (Mentioned - Captain of the *Sarcomond*)

**Important developments in the PCs' lives or for the campaign**
*   The crew confirms their next objective: locate the pirates in the Borite system before the trail goes cold.
*   The long-term plan is established to abduct Doctora Torcan on the planet Talasa (Ipres sector) to obtain secrets about organic tissues.
*   The players' ship has suffered critical damage to the jump drive (a -2 penalty) and hull due to a failed attempt to refuel in a gas giant, forcing them to spend funds on repairs and fuel.
*   The crew becomes familiar with space combat protocols and their ship's capabilities, discovering they have considerable firepower but defensive shortcomings (lack of sandcasters).

**Loose ends**
*   Investigation on the surface of Borite to find the trail of the *Miseries Company*.
*   The urgent need to repair the ship's hull hit points and jump drive.
*   Acquire defensive countermeasures (sandcasters) and missiles for future real combat.

## Intelligence Review and Flight Plan
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None (Mention of previous contacts).
**Location:** Inside the ship, in transit to Borite.
**Ships:** *Miseries Company* (Scout, Captain Krusch), *Sarcomond* (Captain Daniel Blau).

The crew reviews information previously obtained through the merchant Holmer. They confirm that the *Miseries Company*, captained by Krusch, sold high-value "computer scrap" in Torpol before fleeing to Borite after an encounter with the ship *Sarcomond*. They also discuss the mission commissioned by an "aunt in orbit" (possibly Lady Hil or an associate) to abduct the geneticist Doctora Torcan on Talasa.
Due to a previous incident piloting near a gas giant, the ship has a damaged jump drive and a weakened hull. Captain Nemo decides that upon arrival at Borite, they will buy unrefined fuel to process it on board, rather than risking collecting it again.

## Arrival at Borite and Logistics
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None directly.
**Location:** Spaceport or orbit of Borite (Borite System).

Upon arriving in the system, work is divided. Paloma and Nemo handle ship matters: buying fuel and overseeing refining and basic repairs. Meanwhile, Juan (Jimmy) and Alvarito (Fomega) prepare to go ashore and investigate the pirates' trail, attempting to be discreet. The need to save money ("machacantes") is emphasized, as hull repairs are extremely costly.

## Combat Simulation: The Cowardly Hare
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Blaine (Simulator Instructor).
**Location:** Holodeck / Ship's simulator.
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Harrier, PCs' Ship), *Cowardly Hare* (Free Trader / Freighter).

Blaine sets up virtual scenarios to train the crew in space combat. In the first scenario, they face a merchant freighter attempting to flee.
*   **Roles:** Paloma pilots, Nemo coordinates (Leadership), Rocío handles turrets, Emilio takes care of electronic warfare, and Fomega manages sensors/engineering.
*   **Action:** Emilio manages to block the enemy's communications to prevent them from calling for help. The ship proves to be far superior in speed and armament. Rocío fires the particle battery, causing massive damage that incapacitates the freighter, forcing its surrender. They learn the importance of managing thrust and distances.

## Combat Simulation: The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Blaine (Instructor).
**Location:** Holodeck / Ship's simulator.
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Harrier, PCs' Ship), *Q-Ship* (Armed trap freighter).

The second scenario presents a ship that appears to be a vulnerable merchant but turns out to be a trap (*Q-Ship*) with hidden turrets.
*   **Development:** The combat is much tougher. The PCs' ship suffers simulated critical damage, including the destruction of the jump drive.
*   **Tactics:** The use of missiles is tested. They discover that although they are expensive and can be intercepted, if they hit, they cause devastating damage (multiplied by the attack's effect).
*   **Conclusion:** Although they win the simulation, the crew realizes how vulnerable they are to critical hull damage and the imperative need to acquire defenses against missiles and lasers. Captain Nemo ends the training session.
