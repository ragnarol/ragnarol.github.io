Here is the session summary following the requested format and in Spanish from Spain.

# Arde Cordán: Chickens, Fire, and Marquessates

**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro. (At the end of the session, they join the rest of the fleet and the PC Nemo appears).
**NPCs present:** Baroness Lux, Karim, Ramón, Alfredo, Goran (Corpse).

**Main developments in the PCs' lives or the campaign's objective:**
*   The PCs manage to destabilize the political situation in Cordán by inciting a border war between Baron Halley and Baron Ferro, allowing Baroness Lux to establish herself as a mediator and peacemaker.
*   As a reward for their services, Baroness Lux names the PCs **Marquises of Indus**, granting them land (albeit partially in ruins) and a safe harbor in Cordán.
*   The remains of Goran (the deceased former companion) are recovered and buried on the lands of Indus.
*   The group reunites with the rest of the fleet in the Clarke system after several weeks of operations.

**Loose ends:**
*   8 tons of weapons they have stored are yet to be sold.
*   The PCs have recordings of "chicken fights" that turned out to be black because the camera had its lens cap on.
*   The long-term management of the Marquessate of Indus (although it remains on its own).
*   The GM still needs to send the "bill" for ship maintenance and the piracy profits of the other crew.

**Session Joke:**
To justify their presence in the city of Elatón and move freely, the characters invent that they are a documentary crew filming a viral report on "Cordanian Chickens" and their bloody fights. They spend days pretending to film, winning over the locals and even the guards. However, at the end of the session, when they discuss editing the footage to maintain their cover, Kleiton (Álvaro) realizes he never took the lens cap off the camera, leaving them with hours of chicken sounds and a black screen.

### Scene 1: The Conspiracy in the Villa
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro.
**NPCs present:** Baroness Lux (Manipulative and calculating aristocrat, Archetype: The Machiavellian), Karim (Loyal pilot).
**Location:** Baroness Lux's Villa (Planet Cordán).
**Ships:** The Ginger (Cargo ship, Pilot Karim/Kleiton).

**Summary:**
After being healed and resting at Baroness Lux's villa, the PCs meet with her in the garden. Lux explains that she wishes to weaken Barons Halley and Ferro, but without either winning a total war, so that she can position herself above them. The group dismisses the idea of a direct attack (like blowing up a bridge with explosives they don't have) and decides to incite a popular revolt in the border city of Elatón. The plan consists of burning food supplies (silos and granaries) to provoke famine and discontent, blaming the poor management and oppression of Baron Halley, so that Lux can then appear as the savior with humanitarian aid.

### Scene 2: Chicken Reporters
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro.
**NPCs present:** Border control guards (Generic soldiers).
**Location:** Spaceport and roads to Elatón (Planet Cordán).
**Ships:** The Ginger (Mentioned).

**Summary:**
The group forges documentation to pose as foreigners. Lacking a good alibi, they invent that they are a television crew making a documentary about the famous "Cordanian Chicken" fights. Kleiton acts as the cameraman, Daijiro as the local guide, and Lyra as the reporter/producer. Thanks to this lie and the group's charisma, they manage to pass the military and police checkpoints on the way to Elatón, even being welcomed by locals who want to show them their fighting cocks.

### Scene 3: Fire in Elatón
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro.
**NPCs present:** Ramón (Leader of the local resistance, wounded and radical), Alfredo (Local contact).
**Location:** City of Elatón (Planet Cordán), Grain warehouses.

**Summary:**
Once in Elatón, a fortified and tense city, the PCs split up. While Kleiton keeps watch on guard patrols, Daijiro infiltrates the agricultural facilities and burns the food warehouses using local flammable materials. The situation becomes critical. Lyra takes advantage of the chaos to meet with rebel leaders, Ramón and Alfredo, in a cockfighting arena. There, she convinces them to take up arms, promising them military supplies (weapons from *The Ginger*) and tactically suggesting the capture of the bridge connecting to Halley's territory.

### Scene 4: The War and the Marquessate
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro.
**NPCs present:** Baroness Lux (Triumphant peacemaker), Baron Halley and Baron Ferro (Mentioned in negotiations).
**Location:** Cordán (General) and Indus Region.

**Summary:**
The revolt in Elatón erupts violently. The rebels attempt to blow up the bridge and are brutally repressed (Ramón and Alfredo are hanged), which causes Baron Ferro's troops to cross the border, initiating a war. Just as planned, Baroness Lux intervenes with peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid, forcing the other barons to negotiate. Elatón comes under Lux's protection. As payment, Lux grants the PCs the title of Marquises of Indus and some land. Karim manages to recover Goran's bones, which are buried in the new marquessate along with a rat he shot for being on top of the remains.

### Scene 5: Fleet Reunion
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Daijiro, Nemo's character.
**NPCs present:** Byrni Fleet (Allies).
**Location:** Clarke System and Drinax System.
**Ships:** The Ginger (Cargo ship), Drinax/Byrni Fleet.

**Summary:**
The group leaves Cordán and travels to the Clarke system. There they reunite with the rest of the crew and the Byrni fleet, which has broken the blockade and cleared the area of "Yachties" pirates. They catch up, account for the weeks of training, and prepare for the next steps of the campaign, with the allied fleet partially returning to Byrni but leaving an invitation for King Oleb.
