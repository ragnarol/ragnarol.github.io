**Loose Ends:**

## Planning in Black Sand

**PCs present:** Nemo, Jimmy, Paloma, Honor, Pika, Krrsh.
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location(s):** Black Sand City (Planet Theev/Tif), PCs' ship (Hangar/Spaceport).
**Ship(s):** Banshee (Harrier Class, PCs' Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
The group lands in the lower city of Black Sand, on the pirates' planet (referred to as Tif or Cif). They discuss the strategy for capturing Miria, a pirate captain who works for Ferrik and for whose capture (and that of her boss) there is a bounty. They discard an initial direct assault in favor of a mixed approach. Paloma and Rocío (Honor) are tasked with buying supplies and grenades, while Pika manages communications to ensure a closed and secure network among them. Nemo and Jimmy decide to go ahead to scout the terrain disguised as vagrants to avoid drawing attention.

## Ambush at the Scrapyard

**PCs present:** Nemo, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** Three local thugs (Low-level gang members, opportunists).
**Location(s):** The Scrapyard / "Scrapyard" (Outskirts of Black Sand, Planet Theev).
**Ship(s):** None.

**Scene Summary:**
Nemo and Jimmy venture into the scrapyard area, a labyrinthine zone formed by abandoned ship hulls and shacks. During their exploration, they are intercepted by three hostile individuals (a large guy with a club, a woman, and another man). An immediate firefight breaks out. Nemo and Jimmy, superior in armament and tactics, take down two of the assailants (one with a shotgun and another with a laser pistol) and wound the woman, who flees. They briefly loot the bodies, finding only a few credits and alcohol, before abandoning the area to avoid unwanted attention.

## Assault on the Sunken Freighter

**PCs present:** Nemo, Jimmy, Paloma, Honor, Pika, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Miria (Pirate Captain, Thin woman, blue hair, bionic arm with weapon implant).
**Location(s):** Wreckage of a Subsidized Merchant (The Scrapyard, Planet Theev).
**Ship(s):** Merciful (Subsidized Merchant, Miria's ship, wrecked).

**Scene Summary:**
The group regroups and locates the ship where Miria is hiding, a ruined *Subsidized Merchant* half-submerged in toxic water within a crater. They enter through the upper hangar and descend a ladder into the dark, unpowered interior of the ship. As they advance down a corridor, they are ambushed by Miria, who takes cover and opens fire with a minigun attached to her bionic arm.

An intense firefight ensues in the narrow corridor. The PCs take cover and return fire, attempting to flank or stun her, but Miria's armor and position make advancement difficult. Amidst the hail of bullets, Captain Nemo opts for shouted diplomacy. He offers her a deal: join them to take down Ferrik (Miria's boss) in exchange for a portion of the bounty and protection from Admiral Darokin. After tense haggling where Miria demands more money (250,000 credits and half the cargo), they agree to a truce. Miria lowers her weapon, agreeing to meet them at the spaceport "La Calavera" in 48 hours to begin the hunt for Ferrik.
