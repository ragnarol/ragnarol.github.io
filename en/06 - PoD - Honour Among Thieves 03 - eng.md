# Session Title: Diplomacy on Borite and Terror in the Void

**PCs present**
*   **Nemo / Captain James Hondo** (Leader / Face)
*   **Juan / Fomega** (Security / Soldier)
*   **Jimmy Mendoza** (Security / Operations)
*   **Rocío / Tía** (Engineer / Gunner)
*   **Paloma / Honor / Jane** (Pilot / Sensors)
*   **Emilio / Pika** (Engineer / Sensors)

**NPCs present**
*   **Margaret Blaine** (Flight Instructor / Ship's Assistant)
*   **Aboinenan Atalaya** (Officer of the Borite Continuity Authority)
*   **Administrator Ura** (Leader of the local bureaucracy on Borite)
*   **Oghma Raiders** (Nighttime attackers)
*   **Insectoid Creature** (Monster on the space station)

**Main developments in the campaign**
*   The group has split up to optimize time: one team goes down to the planet **Borite** to seek information and supplies, while the other takes the ship to refuel at the gas giant.
*   On **Borite**, the PCs have established a diplomatic relationship with the **Continuity Authority** by repairing a vital mining atmospheric plant, earning 5,000 credits and improving the planet's political status regarding travelers.
*   In space, they have discovered an ancient space station of the Sindal Empire orbiting the gas giant, which is emitting a strange distress signal.

**Loose ends**
*   **The station survivor:** Sensors detected a heat signature (possibly a Vargr) on the space station, but they have not yet made visual contact.
*   **The hull breach:** The insectoid creature has spat acid against the pressurized station hull, causing progressive decompression that threatens Paloma's life.
*   **Oghma Raiders:** The "boogeymen" of Oghma are confirmed to be active in the system and have attempted to assassinate the PCs on the planet.
*   **Interference:** An unknown jamming signal blocked communications between Paloma and Emilio at a critical moment.

## Scene 1: Arrival and Division
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Margaret Blaine (Onboard instructor).
**Location:** Borite System Space (Jump arrival).
**Ship:** Banshee (Harrier Class).

**Scene summary**
After a week of jumping and training with **Margaret Blaine**, the crew arrives in the **Borite** system. Scanners show little activity and confirm that the planet has a low technological level and lacks a real spaceport (Class E). With fuel depleted, the group decides to split up to optimize the remaining time of their main mission:
1.  **Ground Group:** Nemo, Juan, Jimmy, and Rocío will disembark on the ship, land to investigate, and search for spare parts or information about the pirates they are pursuing.
2.  **Space Group:** Paloma and Emilio (along with Margaret) will take the ship to the gas giant to refuel with refined fuel, a task that will take several days.

## Scene 2: Welcome to the Bureaucracy
**PCs present:** Nemo, Juan, Jimmy, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Aboinenan Atalaya (Local police/bureaucracy officer, constantly taking notes).
**Location:** Capital City and Hotel (Planet Borite).

**Scene summary**
The ship drops the ground team off and departs. They are met by a security delegation from the **Borite Continuity Authority**, led by **Aboinenan Atalaya**. Although the atmosphere is oppressive and bureaucratic, they are not hostile. Nemo introduces himself as Captain **Jameson**, a "bounty hunter" or terrorist seeker. Atalaya escorts them by van to the city, questioning them gently. It is revealed that Borite was an old Drinax colony and they fear the slavers of **Oghma**. The PCs are lodged in a hotel under surveillance. At night they try to gather information in local bars, but the population is closed off and distrustful of foreigners.

## Scene 3: The Signal in the Giant
**PCs present:** Paloma, Emilio.
**NPCs present:** Margaret Blaine.
**Location:** Approach to the Gas Giant (Borite System).
**Ship:** Banshee (Harrier Class).

**Scene summary**
As they head to refuel, Emilio detects a distress signal. Upon approaching, they discover it originates from a derelict **space station** orbiting the gas giant. The station appears to be a relic of the Sindal Empire, patched up over the centuries but on the verge of falling into the atmosphere in the distant future. The distress signal is, strangely, a spacesuit beacon attached to the main antenna to amplify it. Thermal sensors detect a single life form (possibly a wounded or weak Vargr) inside. They decide to investigate and dock before refueling, fearing a trap but wanting to rescue the survivor or capture them if they are an enemy.

## Scene 4: Deal in the Mines
**PCs present:** Nemo, Juan, Jimmy, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Administrator Ura (Local leader, pragmatic), Aboinenan Atalaya.
**Location:** Administration Office and Boro Mine (Planet Borite).

**Scene summary**
The ground group meets with **Administrator Ura**. She confirms they haven't seen other ships recently but offers a deal: if the "technicians" of the crew can repair a vital atmospheric plant in one of their mines that has been failing for months, Borite will pay them and establish good relations. They accept the deal. They travel several hours to a remote mine. **Rocío**, with the physical assistance of **Juan**, works for hours in harsh conditions (heat and boro vapors) and manages to repair the machinery, earning the favor of the local authorities.

## Scene 5: Night Assault
**PCs present:** Nemo, Juan, Jimmy, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Oghma Raiders (Poorly equipped but stealthy assassins).
**Location:** Mine Barracks (Planet Borite).

**Scene summary**
While they sleep in the mine barracks, they are attacked. **Juan** and **Nemo** wake up just before their doors are kicked open.
*   **Juan** reacts instinctively and destroys his attacker with a burst from his automatic shotgun.
*   **Nemo** is shot in the shoulder but retaliates with his laser pistol, severing his assailant's arm and killing him.
*   **Jimmy** secures the perimeter with his shotgun.
*   **Rocío** stays in cover.
The attackers turn out to be **Oghma** scouts who were likely watching the area. The rest of the attackers flee into the darkness.

## Scene 6: Terror on the Sindalite Station
**PCs present:** Paloma, Emilio.
**NPCs present:** Insectoid Creature (Hostile, spits acid).
**Location:** Interior of the Space Station (Orbit of the Gas Giant).
**Ship:** Banshee (Docked).

**Scene summary**
Paloma boards the pressurized section of the station while Emilio monitors from the ship and prepares to disembark. Suddenly, interference blocks communications. Paloma finds herself alone and in the dark when an **insectoid creature** attacks her from the ceiling.
*   Paloma manages to dodge the bites and shoots the monster, wounding it but not killing it. She runs towards the airlock to escape.
*   Emilio tries to open the airlocks manually from the other side to help her, but the mechanism is slow and heavy.
*   The creature spits a stream of acid. Paloma dodges it, but the acid hits the door and the ancient station hull.
The session ends with the hull beginning to give way from the acid, causing a depressurization of the room where Paloma is trapped, as Emilio struggles to open the door.
