# Session Title: Snub in Hilfer and the Imperial Gold Route

**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fermín, Paloma, Emilio, Alvarito, Rocío (PC).
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Aslan Bodyguard), Thao Polloc (referred to as "Harp," expert mechanic), Jimmy (Crewman/Gunner), Wolf (Crewman).

**Main Developments:**
*   A new command dynamic is established where Captain Nemo makes executive decisions after hearing opinions, avoiding slow votes.
*   Merchandise is sold in the Paal system, yielding significant profit (127,800 credits).
*   A rumor is discovered about an imperial convoy ("Treasure Ship") which could be a high-level long-term target.
*   An immediate piracy and diplomacy route is charted: Paal -> Sink (hunt) -> Byrni (sale/diplomacy).

**Loose Ends:**
*   The convoy of the **Martin II** (the treasure ship): Its existence and possible route are known (from Tobias/Fist towards Hierato Aslan), but intercepting it requires complex planning and possibly allies.
*   Hostility in **Hilfer**: The planet hates Drinax and is marked as a potential future hunting ground, as diplomacy is impossible.
*   Fermín's physical recovery after the accident with the supply box.

### Scene 1: Jump and Convalescence
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fermín, Paloma, Emilio, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Wolf and Harp (Crewmen, criticize Fermín's accident calling him "Fermín the Cookie").
**Location:** Space (During the jump from Purne to Hilfer) and the ship *Harrier*.
**Ships mentioned:** Harrier (PCs' Ship).

**Scene Summary:**
During the week-long jump to Hilfer, the crew dedicates themselves to study and maintenance. Fermín, still injured from the cargo accident (lost Endurance points), tries to recover and spends his time reviewing recordings of Jane Cobb's medal ceremony, looking for suspicious behavior or conspiracies, though he finds nothing relevant. An inventory is taken of previously stolen cargo: common consumables (low-quality food), mechanical parts, and basic electronics. Harp performs ship maintenance and "cleans" the stolen boxes to hide their origin.

### Scene 2: Hostility in the Desert
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fermín, Paloma, Emilio, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (accompanies the landing party).
**Location:** Hilfer (Hilfer System), Surface Spaceport (Downport).

**Scene Summary:**
The crew lands on Hilfer, a desert world with Technology Level 6 and Law A (very strict, weapons prohibited). Upon disembarking and interacting with locals at the dusty port, they discover a deep hostility towards outsiders, and specifically hatred towards Drinax (whom they blame for past bombings or lack of protection). The atmosphere is so tense and xenophobic that the group decides to abort any attempt at trade or diplomacy. They pay docking and fuel fees (around 3,000 credits total plus fuel) and take off immediately to avoid legal or physical conflicts. Hilfer is marked as a hostile territory suitable for future piracy.

### Scene 3: Business and Rumors in Paal
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fermín, Paloma, Emilio, Alvarito, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Emanuel Pelli (Generated name for a failed contact), local merchants, pilots.
**Location:** Paal (Paal System), Spaceport and leisure areas.

**Scene Summary:**
After jumping from Hilfer, the ship arrives at Paal, a rich, agricultural, and bustling world ("Capitalism at its finest"). They split into groups:
*   **Paloma:** Is in charge of selling the stolen merchandise. Despite her social anxiety, she achieves great commercial success, selling electronics at 110% and industrial goods at 135%, totaling 127,800 credits for the crew.
*   **Nemo, Emilio, and Rocío:** Attempt to bribe customs officials and seek contacts. They discover that local nobles politically despise Drinax, but covet luxury goods (cars, grav tanks, cybernetics). They also notice a great fear in the population of an impending Aslan invasion, especially from the *ihatei* (landless second sons).
*   **Alvarito and Fermín:** Visit pilot bars. Alvarito, pretending to be a drunken merchant, obtains a valuable rumor from an imperial pilot: a treasure convoy (the *Martin II*) is being prepared to travel from the Empire towards Aslan space.

### Scene 4: The War Council
**PCs present:** Captain Nemo, Fermín, Paloma, Emilio, Alvarito, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** None directly.
**Location:** Paal (Paal System) / Ship Harrier.
**Ships mentioned:** Martin II (Imperial convoy/treasure ship, Jump-3), Harrier.

**Scene Summary:**
The crew debates what to do with the information about the "Golden Galleon" (*Martin II*). Some want to pursue it immediately, charting an interception route towards the Exe or Tech-World system. Others, seeing the difficulty of assaulting a militarized imperial convoy with their current resources, prefer to stick to the original plan of kingdom reconstruction. Finally, Captain Nemo decides on a hybrid plan: they will depart Paal for the **Sink** system (a poor system with gas giants) to ambush ships and practice piracy ("hunt"), and then jump to **Byrni** to sell what they steal and establish diplomatic contact, staying close to the convoy's possible route should an opportunity arise.
