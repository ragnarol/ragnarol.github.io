## Scene: Brainstorming and Logistics
**PCs present:** The whole group (tactical discussion).
**NPCs present:** None.
**Location:** Outside the ship / Base of operations (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships:** None.

**Summary:**
The group heatedly discusses how to introduce illegal equipment (computers, drugs, weapons) into the Treasure Ship, which has strict security controls with scanners. Scatological ideas about hiding objects in bodily cavities and using distractions are debated. Alvarito proposes a lethal plan using drugs in the vacuum suits, but the group prefers a more subtle approach. Finally, they decide to stop rambling and start executing concrete intelligence and infiltration actions day by day.

## Scene: Day Shift - The Drill
**PCs present:** Pika, Jane, Alvarito.
**NPCs present:** Mechanic Polo (Superstitious), Marines on guard.
**Location:** Engineering (Treasure Ship, Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships:** Treasure Ship (Imperial).

**Summary:**
During the work shift in engineering, Pika attempts to investigate the life support systems to see if the vault has its own atmosphere (concluding it doesn't seem designed to house life). Suddenly, a "general quarters" alarm sounds. The crew and PCs must don vacuum suits and remain in safety cubicles for three hours. The group identifies this drill period as a perfect window of opportunity to act in the future, as the routine is broken.

## Scene: Social Engineering and Friendships
**PCs present:** Rocío, Paloma, Honor, Tía.
**NPCs present:** Mechanic Thalys (Archetype: The depressed widow), Marine Sharif (Archetype: The elegant one), Captain Torsa (mentioned as incompetent/nepotism), Officer Hallard (mentioned as competent and tough).
**Location:** Engineering and Mess Hall (Treasure Ship).
**Ships:** Treasure Ship.

**Summary:**
Rocío gains the trust of Thalys, a mechanic depressed by the death of her partner Fellmark in the ship's accident. Thalys reveals that First Officer Hallard is the one actually running the ship, while Captain Torsa is a useless figure put in place through connections. Meanwhile, Paloma tries to find out the marines' shifts through minor hacks and observation.

## Scene: The Old Guard and the Taxi
**PCs present:** Pika, Paloma, Rocío.
**NPCs present:** Pilot Smith (Archetype: The veteran about to retire), Pilot Handshow (Archetype: The space taxi driver).
**Location:** Mess Hall (Treasure Ship).
**Ships:** Treasure Ship.

**Summary:**
During mealtime, Pika sits with Pilot Smith and pilot Handshow. Smith is an older man who just wants to retire and considers the ship a boring "flying safe," though he confirms it transports documents, jewels, and radioactive materials. He mentions that pirates don't dare to attack them. Paloma tries to join the conversation but is ignored by the veteran.

## Scene: Device Infiltration
**PCs present:** Paloma, Rocío, Honor.
**NPCs present:** Marine Salvedes, Marine Cera (Security Guards).
**Location:** Access Control Point (Treasure Ship).
**Ships:** Treasure Ship.

**Summary:**
The group decides to introduce hidden microphones (bugs) and a high-tech camera (TL13). Upon passing through the security scanner, the device detects something on Paloma. Through a quick distraction maneuver using a hairpin and sleight of hand with Rocío (who hides the device), they manage to convince the marines it's a sensor error or a simple buckle, successfully smuggling the espionage equipment onto the ship.

## Scene: Vault Reconnaissance
**PCs present:** Pika (Emilio), Paloma.
**NPCs present:** Generic crew in the mess hall.
**Location:** Near the Vault (Cargo Hold, Treasure Ship).
**Ships:** Treasure Ship.

**Summary:**
Taking advantage of an oversight, Paloma places a hidden camera pointing at the vault's entrance. Pika manages to get close enough to inspect the external structure of the vault. He observes it is a black monolith that doesn't reach the ceiling, sealed with a braided material, complex locks, gravitic seals, and a genetic reader for a physical key. Pika tries to analyze further but must retreat to avoid arousing suspicion.

## Scene: Underworld Business and Diplomacy
**PCs present:** Nemo, Nacho's character (Jane/Other).
**NPCs present:** Loadmaster Nippen (Archetype: The drunk stevedore), Aslan Port Lord (mentioned), Local TV crew.
**Location:** City and Port (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships:** Gazelle (mentioned as escort).

**Summary:**
Nemo finds Nippen, the loadmaster, in a bar. Nippen is a loud, drunk man, but Nemo doesn't manage to get much useful information from him immediately. On the other hand, Nemo orchestrates a diplomatic plan: he convinces the local Aslan to send a "tribute" of precious stones to the Empire to gain renown, which will serve as a cover to legally bring cargo (and perhaps the PCs) onto the ship.
In parallel, Nacho's character goes to the black market to buy a scanner jammer for 2,500 credits. Upon leaving, he is intercepted by a local news crew who interviews him live; he tries to pass himself off as an eccentric hunter but nearly causes a diplomatic incident by speaking ill of the Aslan occupation.

## Scene: Port Investigation
**PCs present:** Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Port officials.
**Location:** Arunisiir Port (Offices/Tower).
**Ships:** Orbital station (mentioned).

**Summary:**
Nemo investigates the port's corporate structure. He discovers that the ground port (Downport) is managed by a local oligarch corporation, but the orbital refueling station (Highport) is owned by a subsidiary of GeDeCo, implying larger corporate interests in orbit.
