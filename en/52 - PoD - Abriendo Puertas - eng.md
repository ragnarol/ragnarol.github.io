# Divided Diplomacy: From Blue to Pal

**PCs present**
*   **Captain Lyra Vance (Paloma):** Captain of the *Ginger*.
*   **Kleiton (Jimmy/Juan):** Pilot of the *Ginger*.
*   **Goran Dragic (Fomega):** Marine of the *Ginger*.
*   **Nemo/Corben (Segundo):** Self-proclaimed captain of the *Maui*.
*   **Pika (Emilio):** Navigator/Engineer of the *Maui*.
*   **Yankee Foo (Nacho):** Pilot/Passenger of the *Maui*.
*   **Jimmy:** Separates from the group at the start to go on the *Sarcomond*.

**NPCs present**
*   **Purne Customs Agents** (Officials, archetype of Men in Black Bureaucrats).
*   **Blue Arms Corporation Executives** (Businessmen, archetype of Corporate Board).
*   **Members of the Greyhide Movement in Pal** (Concerned civilians, archetype of Grassroots Resistance).
*   **Fermín** (Mentioned crew member, his money is used by Goran).

**Main plot development and reconstruction of the Kingdom of Drinax**
*   The group divides into two expeditions to cover more diplomatic and commercial ground.
*   **The *Ginger* expedition** (Lyra, Kleiton, Goran) achieves resounding success in **Blue**, establishing an agreement for combat fighters and technological collaboration, thus securing vital military strength for Drinax.
*   **The *Maui* expedition** (Nemo, Pika, Yankee) travels to **Pal** to seek allies. Although they manage to sow unease about the Aslan threat through the media, they discover that to win the favor of the local nobles they need to bribe them with specific luxury goods and technology, postponing the mission's success.
*   The foundations for a trade network are laid, purchasing weaponry and electronics in Blue to sell on less technologically advanced worlds like Cordan.

**Loose ends**
*   Jimmy's personal mission, where he separates to pick up **Bogdan Stolich** in Clark and meet **Krrsh**, with arrangements to reunite with the group later.
*   The need to obtain luxury goods (gravitational cars, advanced computers) to bribe the leaders of the city-states of Pal (Duke Mikes and King Ear).
*   The mysterious **Greyhide Movement** in Pal, which requests machinery to manufacture illegal weapons.
*   The final meeting of both ships scheduled in the **Cordan** system.

## Preparations and Farewell
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** None direct.
**Location:** Drinax (Drinax/Drinax System).
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Harrier, Captain Lyra), *The Maui* (Aslan cargo ship, Captain Nemo), *Sarcomond* (Mentioned, Jimmy).

**Summary:**
The group plans the logistics for the coming weeks. They decide to divide into two teams: Lyra, Kleiton, and Goran will go to **Blue** via Clark in the *Ginger*; while Nemo, Pika, and Yankee will go to **Pal** via Purne in the *Maui*. Jimmy bids farewell to carry out his own mission with the Vespexers and pick up a contact. The state of the *Maui*, an Aslan ship valued at 90 million but with strange interiors (shrines, controls in another language) and bloodstains that Pika must clean, is discussed. Goran uses some of Fermín's "inheritance" money to finance operations.

## Bureaucracy on the Frontier
**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Yankee Foo.
**NPCs present:** Customs Agents (Men in gray suits and smoked glasses, suspicious officials).
**Location:** Purne Spaceport (Purne/Purne System).
**Ships:** *The Maui* (Aslan cargo ship, Captain Nemo).

**Summary:**
The *Maui* arrives in **Purne**, a police and bureaucratic world. Upon landing, they are interrogated in a room by agents who suspect an empty Aslan ship. Yankee Foo tries to pose as an important diplomat with little patience, which tenses the situation. Nemo intervenes using his diplomatic skills, claiming a secret mission related to the war in Drinax and the Ihatei threat. They manage to convince the agents, who take notes, concerned about the geopolitical situation, and they are allowed to refuel and depart without being detained, though they confirm that Purne is a difficult place to get quick support.

## Stopover on the Graveyard World
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Goran.
**NPCs present:** Missionaries/Psychopomps (Religious figures who freeze people, background).
**Location:** Clark Spaceport (Clark/Clark System).
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Harrier, Captain Lyra).

**Summary:**
The *Ginger* makes a stopover in **Clark**. They are received amicably thanks to the previous alliance; they receive free fuel and good treatment. They observe the peculiar local culture, where "Psychopomps" freeze pilgrims (some alive) in carbonite for the future. They use the travel time and stay to prepare audiovisual material (images of the attack on Drinax) and study technical data for their presentation in Blue. They buy local themed food (incense and "funeral hits") before departing.

## Agitation in the City-States
**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Yankee Foo.
**NPCs present:** Members of the Greyhide Movement (Local partisans, followers of Prince Richard Greyhide).
**Location:** Surface and Spaceport of Pal (Pal/Pal System).
**Ships:** *The Maui* (Aslan cargo ship, Captain Nemo).

**Summary:**
In **Pal**, the team encounters a world fragmented into city-states without a central government and with great paranoia towards the Aslans. Nemo conducts a media tour, appearing on television to warn about the Ihatei invasion and the need to support Drinax, gaining some popularity. Yankee and Pika investigate and discover that the local nobles are frivolous and will only support the cause in exchange for specific technological gifts (luxury cars, computers). Nemo attends a barbecue/meeting of the **Greyhide Movement**, a group of concerned citizens who cannot offer ships or money, but request machinery to manufacture weapons and resist. Lacking the necessary bribes for the nobles at that moment, they decide to depart for Byrni and Cordan.

## The Fighter Jet Deal
**PCs present:** Lyra, Kleiton, Goran.
**NPCs present:** Board of Directors of the Arms Corporation (Business executives).
**Location:** Corporate meeting room at the Spaceport (Blue/Blue System).
**Ships:** *The Ginger* (Harrier, Captain Lyra).

**Summary:**
The team arrives in **Blue**, a high-tech corporate world. They secure a meeting with the fighter jet manufacturing company. Lyra, supported by Kleiton (providing technical pilot knowledge) and Goran (military tactics), gives a masterful presentation. They show images of the war and, crucially, they not only offer money but **advanced technology from the Tower of the Scholars of Drinax**, trade routes, and technical training. The negotiation roll is a critical success. They agree on the shipment of fighter jets, the establishment of a training campus, and improve diplomatic relations. They take advantage of the visit to purchase 10 tons of advanced weaponry and 40 tons of common electronics for trade at their next destination.
