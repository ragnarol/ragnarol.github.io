*   Aslan Light Freighter (300 tons).

**Scene summary**
After arriving in the system and transferring the required funds to the King's secret accounts, the crew attends the Floating Palace by royal order. Krrsh paints his fur in bright colors and uncomfortably harasses the Imperial Consul Thao Polloct. James Hondo reunites with his sister, Lía Hondo, with whom he has a tense conversation full of reproaches about the family inheritance; Jimmy attempts to woo her unsuccessfully. James tries to gauge the political loyalties of the court to find allies for Princess Rao, identifying possible patterns (Rachando, Lady Hil, Lord Drax, etc.). The presentation before King Oleb is brief and formal.

The group goes to the merchant Rachando's bazaar to acquire spare parts.

They attempt to contact Rachando directly, but only manage to leave a message through his robots offering services and alliances. They observe an Aslan female (Sarah) buying livestock and other supplies, with whom Honor exchanges brief words about trade. They also discuss the sale of stolen laser weaponry.

### The Televised Hunt of the Drinaxian Mole

**Scene summary**
King Oleb wakes the crew for a "hunt" that turns out to be a televised propaganda event. Equipped with vacuum suits and melee weapons (gravitic hammers, saw swords, spears), they descend to the surface of Drinax during a storm to hunt a "Drinaxian Mole" (a giant insectoid beast). During aerial combat with gravitic belts, James Hondo's belt fails (possible sabotage), and Jimmy Mendoza has to rescue him in the air to prevent a crash. King Oleb, ignoring the incident, spectacularly kills the beast for the cameras. After the hunt, the PCs search the ship for intruders, finding no conclusive evidence.

**Scene summary**
Impressed by Hondo's "pack's" performance on television, Lord Fataqiu invites the PCs to his Jaima. It turns out to be a cultural exchange where Fataqiu and James Hondo share their appreciation for art (Hondo shows his holograms) and discuss the philosophy of war (Limited War vs. Open War). Fataqiu laments the destruction of Drinax, considering it a waste of territory. While the males discuss war and art, Honor is sent to talk business with the Aslan females, establishing potential future trade routes and obtaining information about goods in demand in the Aslan Hierate. An important friendly contact is established.
