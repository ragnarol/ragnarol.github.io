# Session Title: Alliance at The Skull and the Hunt in Palindrome

**PCs present:**
*   Nemo (Captain)
*   Pika (Medic/Scientist)
*   Chris (Sniper/Combat)
*   Other crew members (referred to as Rocío and Emilio/Roberto, presumably Krrsh or Honor)

**NPCs present:**
*   Miria (Pirate, Captain of the *Mercyfooch*)
*   Aida (Mentioned out of character, daughter of the GM)

**Important developments in the PCs' lives or the campaign:**
*   A temporary alliance has been established with the pirate Miria to hunt Ferric and collect a bounty of 2,500,000 credits (of which 250,000 will go to Miria).
*   Significant purchases of personal equipment and ship maintenance have been made to prepare for combat.

**Loose ends:**
*   The space combat against Ferric's ship, the *Yan Altosk*, has just begun as it leaves lunar orbit.
*   The crew's financial situation is precarious, with a mentioned accounting deficit of -72,564 credits, though they have cash for immediate operations.
*   Nemo has a pending debt of one million credits (possibly to the Temple of Science or a similar entity) that he has promised to pay "next year."

**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Chris, rest of the crew.
**NPCs present:** None (interaction with purchase systems).
**Location:** Spaceport (System not specified, presumably where they docked previously).
**Ships:** *Banshee* (Model unknown, Captain Nemo/PCs).

**Scene Summary:**
The crew dedicates time to managing the ship's finances. Payment for maintenance (costs of 66,082 or 79,082 credits) is discussed, and the "time track" is updated. Pika reports on his new medical equipment, including *Starlight Drops* (infrared vision drops), a personal medical scanner, and drugs like *Slow Drug* and *Panacea*. He also mentions possessing a Gauss pistol. Nemo attempts to find a holographic projector without success, but purchases a full-body hair treatment (pink hair) as a gesture towards Krrsh. Chris and Pika acquire *Laser Sights* for their weapons.

## Scene: Deal at The Skull
**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Chris (on lookout outside), rest of the crew.
**NPCs present:** Miria (Woman with a cybernetic/iron arm, cynical and distrustful attitude, Veteran Pirate archetype).
**Location:** "La Calavera" bar, located in a spaceport carved into an asteroid.
**Ships:** *Mercyfooch* (Miria's ship).

**Scene Summary:**
The crew heads to "La Calavera" bar to meet with Miria. Chris remains outside as security while Nemo and Pika enter, unarmed of long weapons but with hidden pistols. They find Miria playing *pinball*. After sharing some whiskies, they negotiate the plan to trap Ferric. Miria reveals that Ferric is hiding on a moon awaiting their arrival. They agree that Miria will serve as bait to draw him out, while the PCs' ship, with better sensors, remains hidden to ambush him. Miria demands 250,000 credits and half the cargo for her help. Nemo accepts, they toast, and prepare to depart.

## Scene: Jump to Palindrome and Ambush
**PCs present:** All PCs on the bridge.
**NPCs present:** Miria (via communications), Ferric (via sensors/laser communications).
**Location:** Deep space and Palindrome System (Specifically near the moon of a gas giant).
**Ships:**
*   *Banshee* / *CIF* (PCs' ship).
*   *Mercyfooch* (Miria's ship).
*   *Yan Altosk* (Target ship, Captain Ferric).

**Scene Summary:**
After refueling the *Banshee* (42 tons of fuel), the PCs coordinate the hyperspace jump with Miria's ship. After a week of travel, they arrive in the Palindrome system with only minutes between them. They stealthily head towards the moon of the gas giant where Ferric is hiding. The *Banshee* remains hidden behind the moon or by shutting down active sensors, while Miria approaches and scans the area. Miria contacts Ferric via point-to-point laser. The target ship, *Yan Altosk*, emerges from its hiding place in orbit. At this moment, the PCs' crew initiates a surprise attack.
