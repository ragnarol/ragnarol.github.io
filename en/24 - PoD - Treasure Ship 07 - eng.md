# Operation Anesthesia and Tacos on Arunisiir

**PJs present**
Fomega (Mechanic/Engineer), Emilio "Nemo" (Diplomat/Face), Paloma (Hacker), Jimmy (Driver/Pilot), Fermín (Gunner/Sniper), Ondo.

**NPCs present**
*   **Pilot Henshaw** (Pilot of the *Martin II*, desperate mother under duress).
*   **Captain Bell** (Merchant Captain, Nemo's romantic/commercial interest).
*   **Rocío** (Second Officer of the *Martin II*, strict and suspicious).
*   **Polo** (Chief Mechanic of the *Martin II*, somewhat careless).
*   **Thalis** (Chief Mechanic of the *Martin II*).
*   **Chris** (Vargr, loyal and alert crewmember).
*   **Wolf** (Vargr, bloodthirsty crewmember).
*   **Jane** (Ally/Infiltrated crewmember).
*   **Aunt** (Ally infiltrated on the ship).
*   **Álvaro** (Contact for dubious goods).

**Major developments in PJs' lives or the campaign**
*   The group advances in the plan to hijack the *Martin II*: they plan to gas the crew using the vacuum suits or the life support system.
*   Nemo establishes a commercial (and personal) relationship with Captain Bell to sell the loot (gems and precious metals) and gain liquidity.
*   The manipulation of Pilot Henshaw is consolidated, ensuring her cooperation to facilitate access to the shuttle during the assault, using her daughter's safety as leverage.
*   Fomega earns the respect of Chief Mechanic Thalis, improving his infiltrated position.

**Loose ends**
*   Nemo failed to find a seller for the anesthetic or gas needed for the plan, leaving the acquisition of the "drug" pending.
*   The *Banshee*, hidden in the forest, is in danger of being discovered due to the unexpected arrival of a film crew (possibly for a reality show) right next to its hiding place.
*   The biometric security of the armory and the permits of Second Officer Rocío remain an obstacle that Paloma is trying to overcome.

## Morning Planning and Logistics
**PJs present:** Fomega, Emilio (Nemo), Paloma, Jimmy, Fermín, Ondo.
**NPCs present:** Jane (Ally).
**Location:** Crew Quarters/Ship *Banshee* (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** *Banshee* (Destroyer, Unknown Captain), *Martin II* (Heavy Freighter, Unknown Captain).

**Scene Summary**
The group discusses options following the revelation of Pilot Henshaw's situation. Fomega proposes a plan to manipulate the vacuum suits or the air to incapacitate the crew of the *Martin II* instead of fighting, although they need to acquire the chemicals. Emilio (Nemo) and Jane insist on maintaining their cover and buying time. Tasks are divided: the infiltrators (Fomega, Emilio, Paloma, Jane) will go to their work shifts on the *Martin II*, while the ground team (Jimmy, Fermín) will go to the *Banshee* to watch over and move cargo. Fomega tries to socialize with Pika's help to improve his interactions with the NPCs.

## Military Post Exploration
**PJs present:** Jimmy, Fermín.
**NPCs present:** Chris (Vargr, scout/bodyguard), Wolf (Vargr), Abra. Local Guards (Bored Military).
**Location:** Forests and rocky area (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** None.

**Scene Summary**
Jimmy and Fermín, accompanied by the Vargr, take a truck from the *Banshee* to explore a nearby facility previously spotted. Fermín stays as a sniper covering the area while Jimmy and Chris approach stealthily. The facility appears to be a regional police or communications barracks with antennas and official vehicles. They are almost discovered when Chris makes noise, alerting the guards who were patrolling smoking, but they manage to retreat without initiating a firefight. They decide it's not worth attacking and return.

## Business and Seduction at the Port
**PJs present:** Emilio (under the alias "Nemo").
**NPCs present:** Captain Bell (Independent Trader, honest and cautious).
**Location:** Pax Rulin food restaurant (Arunisiir Spaceport).
**Ships mentioned:** Captain Bell's Ship (Merchant, Captain Bell).

**Scene Summary**
Nemo meets with Captain Bell for dinner to negotiate the sale of the tons of precious metals and gems they have stored. Bell agrees to act as an intermediary (broker) for a 5% commission, making it clear she wants no part in piracy. The evening extends, Nemo uses his charm to talk about the glory of Drinax, and they end up spending the night together at a hotel, consolidating the relationship for future logistical favors.

## Infiltration and Hacking on the Martin II
**PJs present:** Paloma, Fomega, Emilio, Aunt (PJ/Ally).
**NPCs present:** Polo (Chief Mechanic, incompetent/relaxed), Rocío (Second Officer, diligent and controlling), Thalis (Chief Mechanic).
**Location:** Engineering Deck and Mess Hall (Ship *Martin II*).
**Ships mentioned:** *Martin II* (Heavy Freighter).

**Scene Summary**
During their work shifts, the team attempts to advance the sabotage. Paloma hacks the logs to study Second Officer Rocío's patterns and armory security, discovering that the officer is very active and personally supervises repairs. Fomega investigates the vacuum suit lockers. Emilio uses his social skills to convince Polo to change work shifts, managing to get Paloma and himself on the same schedule to better coordinate their illegal actions. Aunt tries to approach Rocío without success.

## Mr. Wolf and the Pilot
**PJs present:** Emilio (Nemo), Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Pilot Henshaw (Coerced Mother), Jane (Liaison), Álvaro (Criminal Contact).
**Location:** Discreet and noisy corner (Arunisiir Spaceport).
**Ships mentioned:** *Martin II*, Iron Two's Ship (Mentioned as a threat).

**Scene Summary**
Nemo and Fomega meet with Pilot Henshaw. Nemo adopts the persona of "Sam Bigman" (a kind of "Mr. Wolf" who solves problems). They dismiss Henshaw's desperate plan to sabotage the engine by brute force and present her with a professional plan: to take the bridge and the ship in a coordinated manner. They pressure her by assuring her it's the only way to save her daughter from Iron Two/Aeron Tuss. They get Henshaw to agree to collaborate by facilitating access to the shuttle and cloning her access card, under the promise of rescuing her daughter afterward.

## The Reality Show Threat
**PJs present:** Fermín, Jimmy.
**NPCs present:** Film crew (Civilians/Media), Private security guards.
**Location:** Edge of the forest near the ship's hiding place (Planet Arunisiir).
**Ships mentioned:** *Banshee* (Hidden).

**Scene Summary**
Returning with the truck towards where the *Banshee* is hidden to bring supplies, Fermín and Jimmy stumble upon a van and a deployment team. They observe them unloading recording equipment and cameras, apparently to film a television show or reality show in the wilderness, right in the area where they have their pirate ship hidden, posing a critical and immediate security risk.
