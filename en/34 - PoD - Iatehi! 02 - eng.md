# The Ihatei Assembly in Kteiroa

**PCs present**
*   **Nemo:** Captain/Diplomat. Poses as the leader of a group of mechanics.
*   **Paloma:** Communications Officer/Intelligence. Seeks information and merchandise.
*   **Goran:** Artist and technician.
*   **Fermín:** Engineer/Researcher.
*   **Pika:** Crew member (mentioned).
*   **Álvarito and Rocío:** Crew members (allied NPCs, medic and mechanic).

**NPCs present**
*   **Kakh'syl / Kasiil** (Renegade Aslan, guide and interpreter for the group. Lives in Drinax).
*   **Utea** (Female Aslan, spaceport administrator of Kteiroa. Pragmatic renegade).
*   **Tiau** (Elderly Aslan, agent of the Council of Clans. Archetype: The Diplomat/Observer).
*   **Ziuq** (Aslan, broker and merchant. Archetype: The Mobster/Fixer).
*   **Eihei "The Wise"** (Ihatei leader of the Tiquisto clan. Archetype: The Calculating Strategist).
*   **Old Elion** (Ihatei leader without a clan. Archetype: The Veteran Warrior).
*   **Tojio** (Young and wealthy Aslan from the Hekaher clan. Archetype: The "Influencer" seeking glory).
*   **Ikki** (Ihatei leader of the losing clan Tlaiowaha/Itoguau. Archetype: The Desperate One).

**Campaign Development**
*   The PCs discover the reason for the massive influx of *Ihatei* (landless second sons) into the area: a limited ritual war between the **Hekaher** and **Itoguau** (Tlaiowaha) clans is ending prematurely after 9 years, causing a massive exodus of victorious and defeated warriors towards the Trojan Arm.
*   They identify the main leaders and their intentions: **Elion** wants to attack the heavily defended planet **Pahal**, while **Eihei** plans a systematic conquest of the sector, which is a direct threat to the plans to rebuild the Kingdom of Drinax.

**Loose Ends**
*   The group needs to secure an audience with **Ziuq** to get work and insider information; for this, Goran is painting a picture valued at 10,000 credits as a gift.
*   There is suspicion that the end of the clan war is due to "foul play" or cheating. If the PCs manage to prove it, it could destabilize the alliance and buy time.
*   A dangerous alliance has formed between **Eihei** (the strategist) and **Ikki** (the leader of the desperate reinforcements), increasing the threat to the region.

### Scene 1: Arrival at the Tundra
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Goran, Fermín, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Kakh'syl (Aslan Guide), Utea (Port Administrator).
**Location:** Utea's Spaceport (Planet Kteiroa).
**Ships:** *Courier class Katyuhi* (Kakh'syl's Ship).

**Scene Summary**
The group lands on the frozen, dark world of **Kteiroa**. Kakh'syl briefs them: there are over 5,000 gathered Aslan *Ihatei*, something unusual caused by changes in the Hierate. They meet **Utea**, the port administrator, who suggests they pose as mechanics to remain unnoticed and earn a living. Utea recommends they speak with **Ziuq** (a broker) or **Tiau** (an agent of the clans) to understand the camp's politics. They decide to use Kakh'syl's ship to move towards the main camp for secure communications.

### Scene 2: First Contact and Clan Politics
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Goran, Fermín, Pika.
**NPCs present:** Tiau (Clan Agent, serious diplomat), Ziuq's Guards.
**Location:** Ihatei Camp (Planet Kteiroa).
**Ships:** Several Aslan ships half-buried in the snow.

**Scene Summary**
Upon arriving at the massive and chaotic camp, they attempt to speak with the broker **Ziuq**, but are rejected by his guards for not bringing an appropriate gift, considered a breach of etiquette. However, they are intercepted and brought before **Tiau**, the agent of the clans. Tiau, an elderly diplomat, warns them about the instability of the situation and informs them about the two main leaders: **Eihei "The Wise"** (the richest and most dangerous) and **Old Elion**. Tiau advises them not to interfere in Aslan politics so as not to offend the honor of the clans.

### Scene 3: Infiltration and Intelligence
**PCs present:** Nemo, Fermín, Nacho (Pika, Alvarito, and Rocío mentioned).
**NPCs present:** Kakh'syl, Tojio (Rich/Media Leader), Anonymous Aslan Warriors.
**Location:** Ihatei Camp (Planet Kteiroa).
**Ships:** *Halaheike Class Pocket Warship* (Tojio's Ship, 1,200 tons).

**Scene Summary**
The group splits up. **Fermín** investigates among the campfires and discovers the reason for the gathering: the war between the Hekaher and Itoguau clans on the world **Ke'ai** is ending abruptly in favor of the Hekaher, releasing thousands of troops.
A large warship lands, bringing **Tojio**, a wealthy Aslan seeking glory and broadcasting his life as if it were a "reality show," attracting followers. **Nemo** attempts to socialize but makes an etiquette mistake by touching an Aslan, provoking a duel to first blood which he manages to resolve (and survive) successfully, earning some respect.

### Scene 4: Preparations and Alliances
**PCs present:** Paloma, Goran, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Kakh'syl, Eihei, Ikki (Newly arrived leader).
**Location:** Utea's Spaceport and Ihatei Camp (Planet Kteiroa).

**Scene Summary**
While **Nemo** continues to work as a mechanic in the camp to maintain his cover, **Paloma** and **Goran** return to the spaceport. Paloma searches for luxury goods, and Goran buys art supplies. Five days pass during which Goran works on painting a high-quality picture (valued at about 10,000 credits) to use as a gift and secure the audience with the broker **Ziuq**.
In the camp, the situation worsens: **Ikki**, a furious leader of the losing clan, arrives with many troops. To the detriment of Drinax's interests, Ikki begins to form an alliance with **Eihei**, consolidating a massive force that could attack the Trojan Arm instead of wasting its strength on Pahal.
