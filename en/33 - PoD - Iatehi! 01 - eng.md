### Scene 1: The Audience with the Exile
**PCs present:** Ondo, Paloma, Jay, Goran, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Khashil (Aslan male nearly 3 meters tall, noble exile, gruff but honorable; Archetype: The Fallen Warrior).
**Location:** Balcony of the Floating Palace (Drinax).
**Ships:** None.

**Scene summary:**
After a brief discussion about medical supplies and combat drugs, the group seeks out Khashil, Princess Rao's recommended contact. They find him on a palace balcony living in a high-tech tent and eating raw meat. Ondo attempts to be diplomatic and shows him the recovered *Yuhai* axe. Khashil identifies the weapon as an honor bestowed upon servants but does not recognize the specific clan, confirming it originates from Kteiroa. Khashil agrees to guide them to the planet Kteiroa in exchange for a future favor. He warns that he is a fugitive wanted by assassins in the Hierate and suggests the group pose as mechanics looking for work to infiltrate the *Ihatei* (landless second sons).

### Scene 2: Logistics and Farewells
**PCs present:** Ondo, Paloma, Jay, Goran, Fermín.
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Ally, aggressive but loyal to his "family"; Archetype: The Reckless Comrade).
**Location:** Floating Palace Hangar (Drinax) and an asteroid in the system.
**Ships:** The Banshee (Harrier, Captain Ondo).

**Scene summary:**
The group debates how to travel to Kteiroa: use the holographically disguised *Banshee* or Khashil's ship. They decide to use Khashil's ship to maintain a low profile, leaving the *Banshee* hidden and secured. They say goodbye to Krrsh, who departs for Torpol with a risky plan to steal a ship and retrieve it for the fleet. Jay has an emotional farewell with him. They decide that the PCs will go as mechanics, taking only essential equipment and concealing their true identities and firepower.

### Scene 3: Shadows over Drinax
**PCs present:** Paloma.
**NPCs present:** Chief Grax (Vespexer Leader, worried and direct; Archetype: The Veteran Scout), Rao's Butler (Voice on communicator).
**Location:** Spaceport (Drinax).
**Ships:** Aslan scout ships and armed freighter (mentioned in reports).

**Scene summary:**
As they prepare for the journey, Chief Grax approaches Paloma. She reports that four Vespexers have disappeared in the same area where three unknown Aslan ships (two scouts and an armed freighter) were sighted weeks ago. Grax fears they have been captured or killed. Paloma relays this critical intelligence to Princess Rao's butler, urging Lord Drax and the Star Guard to increase defensive alerts in anticipation of a possible infiltration or precursor invasion.

### Scene 4: Protocol and Culture in Hyperspace
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Khashil.
**Location:** Khashil's ship (Hyperspace).
**Ships:** Khashil's ship (*Ktiyui* model Courier, Captain Khashil).

**Scene summary:**
The group boards Khashil's ship, hidden on an asteroid. It is a luxurious vessel, though strange for human physiology. During the week-long journey in hyperspace, Khashil instructs the group on the situation on Kteiroa (thousands of *Ihatei* warriors gathered) and Aslan culture. He advises them to be submissive, avoid duels (which are typically clawed), and understand that the troop buildup could be due to a charismatic leader or manipulations by larger clans. The objective is to identify if any leader plans to attack Drinax.

### Scene 5: Landing on the Ice
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Utea (Elderly Aslan, fur coat, pragmatic; Archetype: The Renegade Merchant).
**Location:** Spaceport (Kteiroa/Kteiroa System).
**Ships:** Khashil's ship.

**Scene summary:**
They arrive in the Kteiroa system, a place with a greenish star and an icy planet that was formerly *Piper* (bombed by the Empire until it became a radioactive crater). They land at the underground spaceport controlled by a family of Aslan renegades. They are met by Utea, the port matriarch, who charges for docking and warns about the rules. The atmosphere is frontier-like and deals are shady. The group prepares to walk 5 kilometers across the ice towards the *Ihatei* camp to the north, maintaining their cover story of being human mechanics seeking work.
