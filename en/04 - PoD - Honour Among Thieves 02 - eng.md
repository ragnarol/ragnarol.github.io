**Important developments in the PJs' lives or the campaign:**

* It has been confirmed that the target of their current pursuit (the vargr pirate Captain Krrsh/Crash) has fled towards the Borite system.
* The PJs' ship, the *Harrier* (Banshee), has suffered structural damage and a critical hit to the jump drive due to a risky refueling maneuver.

**Loose ends / Pending items:**
* **The Talhasa mission:** Provost Shala has requested the kidnapping of Doctor Torcan and the theft of seeds from a floating biological facility. It remains to be decided when to carry it out.
* **Repairs:** The ship has hull damage and a critical issue with the jump drive that require costly repairs (spare parts) and time.
* **Origin of the scrap:** Krrsh sold old but highly selected computer components. It is unknown where he obtained them.
