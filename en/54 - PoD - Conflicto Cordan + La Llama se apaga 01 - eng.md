### Scene 1: Return to Hell
**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** Voices of the Torpol’s Wake (Allies in distress), Aslan/Ihatei Communications (Enemies).
**Location(s):** Deep Space / Orbit (Drinax System).
**Ship(s):** *Maui* (Freighter/Adventurer, PCs), *Torpol’s Wake* (Patrol Corvette, Ally), *Iki* and other Aslan ships (Warships and fighters, Enemies).

**Scene Summary**
The group aboard the *Maui* returns to the Drinax system expecting a safe zone but finds a war-torn scene. Sensors detect wreckage from recent battles and an Aslan (Ihatei) fleet blockading the planet. The escort ship *Torpol’s Wake*, which arrived shortly before, is under attack by a swarm of fighters. Despite the critical situation, the PCs decide to prioritize reaching the surface of Drinax and avoid direct combat, as their ship is not military. The *Torpol’s Wake* is destroyed, but they manage to launch a lifeboat. The *Maui* successfully lands at the Floating Palace, evading the blockade.

### Scene 2: Landing on Cordan and Bureaucracy
**PCs present:** Lyra, Goran, Kleiton.
**NPCs present:** Camadan Control (Spaceport official).
**Location(s):** Orbit and Camadan Spaceport (Planet Cordan / Borderland System).
**Ship(s):** PCs' Ship (Freighter).

**Scene Summary**
The second group arrives in the Cordan system. They contact Camadan spaceport control and request permission to land directly within Baroness Lux's domain, citing a cargo shipment. They are warned about the necessity of vaccination due to local atmospheric pathogens. The PCs proceed with vaccinations and use the time to research the planet's sociopolitical situation: an agricultural world with a low technological level (1950s appearance), divided into three baronies (Lux, Fero, and Halley).

### Scene 3: Gathering Information in the Bars
**PCs present:** Lyra, Goran, Kleiton.
**NPCs present:** Locals and Travelers (Incidental informants).
**Location(s):** Bars and Spaceport (Planet Cordan).

**Scene Summary**
While waiting, the characters investigate rumors. They discover that Baroness Lux has gained popularity by investing in her people's health, while Baron Halley runs a police state and is suffering trade sanctions from the Empire (possibly unfair or fabricated). Baron Fero and Halley have territorial disputes. The general population lives a simple, agricultural life, with border tensions between the baronies.

### Scene 4: The Baroness's Proposal
**PCs present:** Lyra, Goran, Kleiton.
**NPCs present:** Baroness Lux (Local noble, calculating and ambitious), Butler (Formal servant), Villa Guards (Soldiers).
**Location(s):** Lux's Baronial Halls / Baroness's Villa (Planet Cordan).

**Scene Summary**
After being housed in luxury at Baroness Lux's villa, the PCs dine with her. Lux reveals her fear of an alliance between Barons Fero and Halley to overthrow her. She proposes a dirty job: assassinate **Josefus Agraki**, a tax collector for Baron Halley who is hated by the people, in a disputed border area. The goal is not only to eliminate him but to incite a popular revolt and provoke an armed conflict between Fero and Halley, causing them to weaken each other, allowing Lux to consolidate power without direct Imperial intervention. The PCs discuss cover stories (agricultural merchants) to infiltrate the area.

### Scene 5: Situation Report and Infiltration Plan
**PCs present:** Nemo, Pika, Yankee.
**NPCs present:** Bri Tolar (Star Guard Sergeant, Exhausted Guard/Soldier).
**Location(s):** Floating Palace Spaceport (Planet Drinax).

**Scene Summary**
Now on the ground, Bri Tolar greets the PCs and briefs them on the catastrophe: the Aslans have launched a massive attack, the *Imperatrix* and other defenses are hidden or destroyed. Most critically, the invaders have taken control of ground defenses, including a meson cannon, preventing safe movement in orbit. Princess Rao has fled and Prince Harrik is in hiding. King Oleb is in the palace, in a very bad mood. Yankee proposes a bold plan: lead an infiltration team with *Bespexers* (inhabitants of the lower levels) to hack or disable the meson cannon, while Nemo attempts to manage diplomacy with the King.
