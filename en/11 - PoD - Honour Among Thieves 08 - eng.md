### The Trap on the Moon
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Miria (Captain of the Mercyfuge, temporary ally, pragmatic), Ferrik Redchain (Captain of the Janal Torsk, target, cautious).
**Location:** Orbit of a gas giant moon (Palindrome System).
**Ships:** *The Banshee* (PCs), *Mercyfuge* (Model 400t, Captain Miria), *Janal Torsk* (Far Trader 200t, Captain Ferrik Redchain).

**Summary:**
After traveling to the Palindrome system and refueling, the PCs position themselves in an ambush while the *Mercyfuge* acts as bait. Miria manages to convince Ferrik Redchain to leave his hiding spot on the moon. Once the *Janal Torsk* is exposed, the *Banshee* and the *Mercyfuge* initiate a coordinated attack.

### Space Combat and Revelations
**PCs present:** All.
**NPCs present:** Ferrik Redchain (Desperate, attempts to negotiate).
**Location:** Deep space (Palindrome System).
**Ships:** *The Banshee* (PCs), *Mercyfuge* (Captain Miria), *Janal Torsk* (Captain Ferrik Redchain).

**Summary:**
Space combat erupts. Honor maneuvers the *Banshee* while Rocío and Honor fire the weapons, achieving critical hits that destroy the jump drive and severely damage the hull and power plant of the *Janal Torsk*. Pika effectively blocks enemy communications. Faced with imminent defeat, Ferrik attempts to negotiate his surrender, claiming Admiral Darokin is an Imperial Intelligence spy and offering proof. Nemo rejects the deal, and the crew decides to disable the enemy ship completely, leaving it adrift and losing atmosphere.

### Silent Boarding
**PCs present:** Fomega, James, Nemo, Pika, Honor.
**NPCs present:** Krrsh (Aslan, suggests lethal tactics).
**Location:** Interior of the *Janal Torsk* (Palindrome System).
**Ships:** *The Banshee* (PCs), *Janal Torsk* (Depressurized wreck).

**Summary:**
The PCs decide to wait a few hours for the enemy crew's life support and suit air to deplete to avoid armed resistance. After monitoring the situation with medical sensors, they board the ship. They encounter minimal resistance and corpses; Fomega manages to stabilize and save Ferrik Redchain's life at the last moment to deliver him alive. They loot the ship's computers for data and secure the stolen petrochemical cargo.

### Loot Distribution and Farewell
**PCs present:** Nemo, James, Fomega.
**NPCs present:** Miria (Satisfied with the deal).
**Location:** Ship-to-ship communications (Palindrome System).
**Ships:** *The Banshee* (PCs), *Mercyfuge* (Captain Miria).

**Summary:**
The distribution of loot with Miria is negotiated. To avoid having to meet her again in the future and to settle the agreed-upon debt of 250,000 credits, Nemo and the crew offer her the entirety of the recovered petrochemical cargo (valued at a similar sum). Miria accepts the deal, takes the cargo, and leaves the system. The PCs are left with the prisoner, the data, and the ship's remains, planning their route back towards Torpol or Borite to collect the bounty, considering some piracy along the way.
