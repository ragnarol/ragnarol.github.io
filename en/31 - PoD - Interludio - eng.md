# Logistics, Politics, and the Fate of the Prisoners

**PCs present:** Nemo (Captain), Paloma, Emilio, Jimmy, Fermín, Goran, Tia.
**NPCs present:** Lord Rax (Admiral/Noble), Sal Dancet (Smuggler/Ally), Lady Hil (Noble), Krrsh ( Referred to as Chris/Kursk, Vargr crewman), Dr. Yudita (Doctor/Cyberneticist), Consul Tal Pogue (Imperial Consul).

**Main developments in the PCs' lives or campaign objective:**
*   Enormous profits (tens of millions of credits) are obtained from the sale of the *Martin II*'s cargo and the opening of its vault, securing funds for the *Banshee*'s maintenance and the crew's personal enrichment.
*   Nemo establishes political contact with Lady Hil, who suggests possible alliances in Clarke and Torpol to restore the glory of Drinax.
*   The trail of the *Martin II* theft is erased by disposing of the prisoner crew through a deal with Sal Dancet.
*   Investigations are conducted on Tech-World and Byrni to try and advance events regarding the *Martin II* conspiracy, albeit with limited results.

**Loose ends:**
*   The whereabouts of Aparo, the man who rented the office on Tech-World and appears to be linked to the *Martin II* plot.
*   Krrsh's (Chris) desire to go to Torpol to recover his ship, the *Sarcomand*, which could generate future conflicts if he decides to act on his own.
*   The imminent arrival of a Sindalian archaeology expert from the University of Regina, mentioned by the Imperial Consul.
*   Imperial diplomatic and commercial documents found in the vault that have not yet been processed or sold.

### Logistical and Ethical Dilemmas
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Emilio, Jimmy, Fermín, Goran, Tia.
**NPCs present:** Lord Rax (Noble of Drinax, social superior, pragmatic).
**Location:** Floating Palace and Spaceport (Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** *Banshee* (Heavy bomber fighters, Captain Nemo), *Martin II* (Captured freighter).

**Scene summary:**
The crew intensely debates what supplies and repairs the *Banshee* needs. Lord Rax informs them that the King does not want to take responsibility for the nearly 30 prisoners from the *Martin II*'s crew and demands they be disposed of. Moral and practical options are discussed: executing them, selling them as slaves, or releasing them. Finally, they decide to freeze them in "fridges" (cryogenic pods) and find a way to abandon them far away to buy time before news of the theft spreads.

### The Art of Trade
**PCs present:** Paloma, Nemo (supervising).
**NPCs present:** Local merchants.
**Location:** Markets and Spaceport (Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** N/A.

**Scene summary:**
Paloma takes charge of liquidating the *Martin II*'s cargo. She sells common and uncommon minerals, spices, and advanced manufactured goods. Thanks to her Broker skills, she achieves excellent prices (up to 130% of base value), raising millions of credits for the crew. Certain advanced electronic components are reserved for the *Banshee*'s repairs.

### Pact with the Smuggler
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma, Emilio (implied in management).
**NPCs present:** Sal Dancet (Smuggler/Trader, potential ally, pragmatic).
**Location:** Drinax.
**Ships mentioned:** Sal Dancet's ship (Free Trader).

**Scene summary:**
The group contacts Sal Dancet, who has just arrived in port. Nemo and Paloma negotiate with her to transport the frozen prisoners and abandon them in a remote location (possibly Hilfer) to prevent them from testifying. Sal Dancet accepts the risk in exchange for a portion of the *Martin II*'s loot and future discounts on merchandise, thereby implicating herself in the pirate conspiracy.

### The Group Divides: Tech-World and Byrni
**PCs present:** Fermín, Goran, Tia (Tech-World Team); Jimmy (Byrni Team).
**NPCs present:** Commercial transport crews.
**Location:** Tech-World and Byrni.
**Ships mentioned:** Commercial passenger freighters.

**Scene summary:**
The group divides to investigate during the weeks of inactivity:
*   **Tech-World:** Fermín, Goran, and Tia travel as passengers. They investigate an address linked to the stolen navigation data. They discover that the premises were rented by a shell company ("CP Computing") created by an individual named Aparo (a merchant previously seen in Arunisiir). The office is empty and the company dissolved.
*   **Byrni:** Jimmy travels to this system. He finds a "fossilized" society loyal to the old Sindal Empire, with knightly orders and a strong naval presence, but finds no concrete clues about the *Martin II*'s original crew or the conspiracy.

### Cybernetic Enhancements and Court Politics
**PCs present:** Nemo, Paloma.
**NPCs present:** Dr. Yudita (Doctor with a *rigor mortis* grimace and perpetual smile, surrounded by octopus-like robots), Lady Hil (Noble, dressed in holographic projections of sea waves, enigmatic and manipulative).
**Location:** Dr. Yudita's Clinic and Royal Court (Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** N/A.

**Scene summary:**
Several crew members, including Nemo and Paloma, visit Dr. Yudita to install cybernetic implants and genetic enhancements. Later, at court, Nemo has a private conversation with Lady Hil. She criticizes Prince Harrik, deeming him "broken," and advises Nemo to seek funding and influence on the planets Clarke (ancient ruins) or Torpol (tourist and financial paradise) to restore Drinax's glory, warning him not to forget who he is.

### The Consul and the Vault
**PCs present:** Emilio, Paloma, Nemo.
**NPCs present:** Imperial Consul Tal Pogue (Admirer of Sindalian architecture), Krrsh (Vargr crewman, impatient).
**Location:** *Banshee*'s Hangar and Scholars' Tower (Drinax).
**Ships mentioned:** *Banshee*, *Sarcomand* (Krrsh's lost ship).

**Scene summary:**
Imperial Consul Tal Pogue approaches to admire the *Banshee* and comments on the upcoming arrival of an archaeology expert from the University of Regina. In parallel, scholars manage to open the *Martin II*'s vault. Inside, they find encrypted mail, Imperial diplomatic documents, luxury items, radioactive materials, and gems worth tens of millions. The final division of the loot takes place. Krrsh expresses his desire to go to Torpol to ambush the current captain of his former ship, the *Sarcomand*, and recover it, though Nemo asks for patience until receiving orders from Princess Rao.
